It is a well known fact that a finite dimensional Hopf algebra is self injective. 
This is a simple consequence of the classical theorem of Larson and Sweedler
that any such Hopf algebra is Frobenius. Below we offer an alternative proof,
based on the fact that the category $\mathcal M^H_H$ of left Hopf modules is 
semisimple and abstract nonsense regarding adjoint functors.

\begin{Theorem}
Let $k$ be a field and let $H$ be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra over $k$. 
Then $H$ is injective as $H$-module.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof}
There is an obvious functor $O: \mathcal M^H_H \to \Mod H$, which simply forgets
about the comodule structure. On the other hand we have a functor in the opposite
direction $T: \Mod H \to \mathcal M^H_H$, which sends an $H$-module $M$ to $H
\otimes_k M$ with the $H$-module structure of a tensor product, and comodule
structure induced by $H$. These functors are clearly exact, and it is easy
to check that they are both left and right adjoint of each other. Hence
we get a natural isomorphism
\begin{align*}
\Hom_H(-,O(H)) \cong \Hom^H_H(T(-),H).
\end{align*}
Since $T$ is exact and $H$ is trivially injective in $\mathcal M^H_H$, the
functor on the right is exact, which implies that $H$ is injective as an
object in $\Mod H$.
\end{proof}
