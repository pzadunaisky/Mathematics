\textbf{Regarding the referees comment}
\bigskip

We agree with most of the observations of the referee, and thank him for his 
careful reading. We wish to clarify a few points.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Regarding the question of the noetherianity of the algebra $A$, it is 
only necessary to assume that $A$ is left noetherian, since the only point 
where this is used is for the graded version of the Bass-Papp theorem.

\item Regarding Remark 3.2. The product taken there is the product in the 
category of $G$-graded $A$-modules; the space underlying this product is not 
the usual product of vector spaces, since this has no obvious grading. Thus 
given a family $\mathcal M$ of $G$-graded vector spaces their product in the 
category of $G$-graded modules is the vector space whose 
\begin{align*}
\bigoplus_{g \in G} \prod_{M \in \mathcal M} M_g.
\end{align*}
Taking this into acount, the statement is correct, although it clearly needs 
clarification. This is important because it is part of the proof of 
Proposition 4.2.
\end{enumerate}
