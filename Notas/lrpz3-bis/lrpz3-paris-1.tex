\section{Introduction}

The article is organized as follows: section \ref{graded-connected-algebras} contains
general material on connected $\NN^r$-graded algebras. We adapt some well-known 
defintions for connected $\NN$-graded algebras to the $\NN^r$-graded context. The 
regularity properties of $\NN^r$-graded algebras are defined in terms of its category 
of $\ZZ^r$-graded modules, and since an algebra may posses several diferent gradings we 
study how these properties change when the grading changes. In the last subsection we 
prove our main transfer result: if a connected $\NN^r$-graded has a filtration by 
finite dimensional graded subspaces then, under mild technical conditions, the original 
algebra inherits the regularity properties of the associated graded ring, see Theorem 
\ref{transfer}. The key result is Proposition \ref{P:ext-ss}, which is an $\NN^r$-
graded version of the classical spectral sequence relating $\Ext$-spaces of a filtered 
algebra with those of its associated graded algebra. However the finer grading forces us 
to do some careful bookkeeping, and it turns out that property $\chi$, or rather its 
$\NN^{r+1}$-graded analogue, plays a delicate role, see Corollary \ref{ldim}.

In section \ref{qatv} we review the basic theory of affine semigroups and recall some 
results from our previous article \cite{RZ2} on semigroup algebras twisted by a cocycle, 
which are quantum analogues of affine toric varieties. Then we introduce a family of 
algebras with a presentation modeled on that of an affine semigroup; this definition is 
inspired in the classical definition of Hodge algebras and their descendants, namely 
algebras with a straightening law and their quantum versions. We show that these 
algebras have a natural filtration, and give  sufficient conditions for their associated 
graded rings to be quantum affine toric varieties.

Section \ref{q-flag-schubert} contains a quick review of the definitions of quantum flag
varieties and their Schubert subvarieties. We then review Caldero's results on 
cannonical bases for these varieties found in \cite{C}, use them to show that Schubert 
varieties have quantum toric degenerations, and apply the results from the previous
section to deduce some of their homological regularity properties in Theorem 
\ref{Schubert-deg}. 

We finish with a short section \ref{richardson}, where we revisit the results of our 
previous article \cite{RZ} in the context of this article.

\section{Degeneration of graded connected algebras}
\label{graded-connected-algebras}
Let $r$ be a positive integer. Throughout this section $A$ denotes a noetherian connected
$\NN^{r}$-graded $\k$-algebra. Here connected means that the homogeneous component of 
$A$ of degree $(0, \ldots, 0)$ is isomorphic to $\k$ as a ring, so the 
ideal generated by all homogeneous elements of non-zero degree is the unique maximal 
graded ideal of $A$; we denote this ideal by $\m$. Clearly $A/\m \cong \k$ as vector 
spaces, and we will use this isomorphism to give $\k$ the structure of an $A$-bimodule.

\subsection*{Graded modules}
%\label{graded-connected-algebras}

\paragraph
\label{grmod-generalities}
We denote by $\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$ the category of $\ZZ^{r}$-graded $A$-modules with 
homogeneous morphisms of degree $0$. We review some general properties of this category; 
the reader is referred to \cite{NV}*{chapter 2} for proofs and details.

 The category 
$\ZZ^r\Mod A$ has enough projectives and injectives, so we may speak of the graded 
projective and injective dimensions of an object $M$, which we denote by $\pd_A^{\ZZ^r} 
M$ and  $\id^{\ZZ^r}_A M$, respectively. We denote by $\ZZ^{r}\mmod A$ the subcategory 
of finitely generated $\ZZ^{r}$-graded $A$-modules. Since $A$ is noetherian $\ZZ^r 
\mmod A$ is an abelian category with enough projectives. 

For every object $M$ of $\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$ and every $\xi \in \ZZ^{r}$ we denote by $M_\xi$ 
the homogeneous component of $M$ of degree $\xi$. Also, we denote by $M[\xi]$ the object
of $\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$ with the same underlying $A$-module as $M$ and with homogeneous 
components $M[\xi]_{\zeta} = M_{\zeta + \xi}$ for all $\zeta \in \ZZ^{r}$. If
$f: N \to M$ is a morphism in $\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$ then the same function defines a morphism
$f[\xi]:N[\xi] \to M[\xi]$. In this way we get an endofunctor $[\xi]: \ZZ^{r}\Mod A \to
\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$, called the $\xi$-suspension functor; it is an autoequivalence, with 
inverse $[-\xi]$.

%\paragraph
%\label{minimal-projective-resolution}
%If $M$ is a finitely generated $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module then $V = \k \ot_A M$ is a 
%finite dimensional graded vector space. Fix $m_1, \ldots, m_n \in M$ such that their 
%classes modulo $\m M$ form a basis of $V$; then the homogeneous $A$-linear map $p_M: A
%\ot_\k V \to M$ defined by $p_M(1 \ot_\k \overline{m_i})= m_i$ is a minimal projective
%cover of $M$ in $\ZZ^r\Mod A$. By taking a projective cover for $\ker p_M$ and iterating
%the process we obtain a minimal projective resolution of $M$ in $\ZZ^r\Mod A$.

Given $N, M$ objects of $\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$ we set 
\begin{align*} 
  \GrHom_A(N, M) = \bigoplus_{\xi \in \ZZ^r} \Hom_{\ZZ^r\Mod A}(N,M[\xi]).  
\end{align*} 
This is a $\ZZ^{r}$-graded vector space, with its component of degree $\xi \in \ZZ^{r}$
equal to the space of homogeneous $A$-linear maps of degree $\xi$ from $N$ to $M$. For
every $i \geq 0$ we denote by $\GrExt_A^i$ the $i$-th right derived functor of 
$\GrHom_A$. We point out that 
\[
  \GrHom_A(N[\xi], M) \cong \GrHom_A(N,M[-\xi]) \cong \GrHom_A(N,M)[-\xi],
\]
as $\ZZ^r$-graded vector spaces, and that these isomorphisms induce analogous ones for 
the coresponding right derived functors.

\paragraph
\label{ext-change-of-grading}
Given $\xi = (\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_r) \in \ZZ^r$ we set $|\xi| = \xi_1 + \cdots +
\xi_r$. Given a $\ZZ^{r}$-graded vector space $V$, we denote by $|V|$ the $\ZZ$-graded
vector space whose $n$-th homogeneous component is 
\begin{align*}
  |V|_n = \bigoplus_{|\xi| = n} V_\xi.
\end{align*}
In particular $|A|$ is a connected $\NN$-graded algebra. Also, if $M$ is a 
$\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module then $|M|$ is a $\ZZ$-graded $|A|$-module, and this 
assignation is functorial. Since $A$ is noetherian, \cite{RZ2}*{Proposition 1.3.7} 
implies that for every $i \geq 0$ and any pair of $\ZZ^r$-graded modules $N, M$, with $N$
finitely generated, there is an isomorphism of $\ZZ$-graded modules
\[
  |\GrExt^i_A(N,M)| \cong \GrExt^i_{|A|}(|N|,|M|),
\]
natural in both variables. 

%\newpage 
\subsection*{Homological regularity properties}
%\label{homological-regularity}

In this subsection we discuss some homological properties a connected $\NN^r$-graded
algebra may posses. Most of the material found in this section is standard for connected
$\NN$-graded algebras.

\paragraph
\label{chi}
Let $M$ be a $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module. We say that $\chi(M)$ holds if for each $i \geq 
0$ the graded vector space $\GrExt_A^i(\k, M)$ is finite dimensional, and say that the
algebra $A$ has property $\chi$ if $\chi(M)$ holds for every finitely generated 
$\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module $M$. Property $\chi$ was originally introduced in 
\cite{AZ}*{section 3} and plays a fundamental role in noncommutative algebraic geometry.

\paragraph
\label{torsion-functor}
Associated to $A$ and $\m$ there is a \emph{torsion functor} 
\begin{align*} 
  \GG_\m: \ZZ^{r}\Mod A &\to \ZZ^{r}\Mod A \\ 
  M &\longmapsto \{x \in M \mid \m^n x = 0 \mbox{ for } n \gg 0\}, 
\end{align*} 
which acts on morphisms by restriction and correstriction. The torsion functor is left
exact, and for each $i \geq 0$ its $i$-th right derived functor is denoted by $H_\m^i$ 
and called the \emph{$i$-th local cohomology functor} of $A$. 

There exists a natural isomorphism
\begin{align*} 
\GG_\m \cong \varinjlim_n \GrHom_A(A/\m^n, -) 
\end{align*}
which by standard homological algebra extends to natural isomorphisms
\begin{align*} 
H^i_\m \cong \varinjlim_n \GrExt^i_A(A/\m^n, -) 
\end{align*} 
for all $i \geq 1$. 

We denote by $A^\opp$ the opposite algebra of $A$, which is also
a connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra, and by $\m^\opp$ its maximal graded ideal. We write
$\GG_{\m^\opp}$ and $H^i_{\m^\opp}$ for the corresponding torsion and local cohomology
functors, respectively.

\paragraph
\label{depth-and-ldim}
Given an object $M$ of $\ZZ^{r}\Mod A$, its \emph{depth} and \emph{local dimension}
are defined as
\begin{align*} 
  \depth_\m M &= \inf \{i \in \NN \mid \GrExt^i_A(\k, M) \neq 0\}, \\ 
  \ldim_\m M &= \sup \{i \in \NN \mid H^i_\m(M) \neq 0\},
\end{align*} 
respectively. The \emph{local cohomological dimension} of $A$, denoted by $\lcd_\m A$, is
the supremum of the $\ldim_\m M$ with $M$ finitely generated.

\paragraph
\label{AS-reg}
The following definition is taken from \cite{RZ2}*{Definition 2.1.1}. It is an 
$\NN^r$-graded analogue of the definition of the AS-Cohen-Macaulay, AS-Gorenstein and 
AS-regular properties for connected $\NN$-graded algebras found in the literature, see 
for example the introduction to \cite{JZ}.
\begin{Definition*}
Let $A$ be a connected noetherian $\NN^{r}$-graded algebra.  
\begin{enumerate} 
\item $A$ is called \emph{AS-Cohen-Macaulay} if there exists $n \in \NN$ such that
  $H^i_{\m}(A) = 0$ and $H_{\m^\opp}^i(A) = 0$ for all $i \neq n$.

\item $A$ is called \emph{left AS-Gorenstein} if it has finite graded injective dimension
  $n$ and there exists $\ell \in \ZZ^{r}$, called the \emph{Gorenstein shift} of
  $A$, such that
\[ 
\GrExt_{A}^i(\k,A) \cong 
  \begin{cases} 
    \k[\ell] & \mbox{for } i = n, 
    \\ 0 & \mbox{for } i \neq n,
  \end{cases} 
\] 
as $\ZZ^{r}$-graded $A^\opp$-modules. We say $A$ is \emph{right} AS-Gorenstein if 
$A^\opp$ is left AS-Gorenstein. Finally $A$ is \emph{AS-Gorenstein} if $A$ and $A^\opp$ 
are left AS-Gorenstein, with the same injective dimensions and Gorenstein shifts.

\item $A$ is called \emph{AS-regular} if it is AS-Gorenstein, and its left and right 
graded global dimensions are finite and equal.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{Definition*} 

\paragraph
\label{invariance-by-grading}
The properties discussed in paragraphs \ref{chi} to \ref{AS-reg} are defined in terms of
the category of $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-modules. In \ref{ext-change-of-grading} we defined 
the algebra $|A|$, which is equal to $A$ as algebra but is endowed with a connected 
$\NN$-grading induced by the grading on $A$ and the group morphism $|\cdot|$. The 
maximal graded ideals of $A$ and $|A|$ coincide as vector spaces, so we may ask whether 
the fact that $A$ has property $\chi$, or finite local dimension, or the 
AS-Cohen-Macaulay property, etc., implies that $|A|$ has the corresponding property.

Let us say that a property $P$ does not depend on the grading of $A$ if the following 
holds: for every connected $\NN^t$-graded algebra $B$ with maximal ideal $\n$, which 
is isomorphic to $A$ as algebra through an isomorphism that sends $\n$ to $\m$, $A$ has 
property $P$ if and only if $B$ has property $P$. As shown in 
\cite{RZ2}*{Corollary 1.3.9}, the local dimension of $A$ does not depend on the grading 
of $A$. An analogous result is proved in \cite{RZ2}*{Remark 2.1.7} for the properties 
defined in \ref{AS-reg}. However, the situation is more delicate for property $\chi$. 
The following lemma shows that property $\chi$ is independent of the grading of $A$ 
under the hypothesis that $A$ has finite local dimension; we do not know whether this 
hypothesis can be eliminated.

\begin{Lemma*}
Suppose $\lcd_\m A < \infty$. Then the algebra $A$ has property $\chi$ if and only if
$\chi(A)$ holds.
\end{Lemma*}
\begin{proof}
If $A$ has property $\chi$ then clearly $\chi(A)$ holds. To prove the opposite
implication, assume $\chi(A)$ holds. Recall from \ref{ext-change-of-grading} that for 
every $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module $M$ and for every $i \geq 0$ there exists a graded 
vector space isomorphism
\[
  |\GrExt^i_A(\k, M)|
    \cong \GrExt_{|A|}^i(|\k|, |M|),
\]
so $\chi(M)$ holds if and only if $\chi(|M|)$ holds; in view of this, the hypothesis 
implies $\chi(|A|)$ holds. 

Since $\ldim_{|\m|} |A| = \ldim_\m A < \infty$, we may apply 
\cite{RZ}*{Proposition 2.2.6} and conclude that $|A|$ has property $\chi$. From this
it follows that $\chi(|M|)$ holds for every $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module $M$, and hence so 
does $\chi(M)$.
\end{proof}

\paragraph
\label{chi-and-local-cohomology}
We finish this subsection with a technical result on the relation between property 
$\chi$ and local cohomology. For every $n \in \NN$ we denote by $A_{\geq n}$ the ideal
generated by all homogeneous elements of degree $\xi$ with $|\xi| \geq n$. 

\begin{Lemma*}
Let $M$ be a finitely generated $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module such that $\chi(M)$ 
holds. Then for every $i \geq 0$ and every $t \in \ZZ$ there exists $n_0 \in \ZZ$ such 
that 
\begin{align*}
  \GrExt^i_A(A/A_{\geq n}, M)_\xi &\cong H^i_\m(M)_\xi
\end{align*}
for all $n \geq n_0$ and all $\xi \in \ZZ^r$ such that $|\xi| \geq t$.
\end{Lemma*}
\begin{proof}
Since $\m$ is finitely generated, say by elements $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ with degrees 
$\xi^1, \ldots, \xi^n$ such that $|\xi_i| \geq 1$, clearly $\m^n \subset A_{\geq n}$. 
Setting $l = \max \{|\xi^i| : i = 1, \ldots, n\}$ we obtain $A_{\geq ln} \subset \m^n$. 
Knowing this, the proof of \cite{BS}*{Proposition 3.1.1} easily adapts to show that 
for every $i \geq 0$ there exist natural isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
  \varinjlim_n \GrExt^i_A(A/A_{\geq n}, -) \cong \varinjlim_n \GrExt^i_A(A/\m^n, -) \cong
  H^i_\m.
\end{align*} 
The statement of the lemma will follow if we show that for all $\xi$ as in the
statement, the homogeneous component of degree $\xi$ of the natural map
\begin{align*}
  \pi^n: \GrExt^i_A(A/A_{\geq n}, M) \to H^i_\m(M)
\end{align*}
is an isomorphism for $n \gg 0$.

Fixing $t$ as in the statement, \cite{AZ}*{Proposition 3.5 (1)} implies that
the natural map $\pi^n_d: \GrExt^i_{|A|}(|A|/|A_{\geq n}|, |M|)_d \to H^i_{|\m|}(|M|)_d$
is an isomorphism for all $d \geq t$ if $n$ is large enough. Now by 
\cite{RZ2}*{Propositions 1.3.7 and 1.3.8} there exist isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
\GrExt^i_{|A|}(|A|/|A_{\geq n}|, |M|)_d 
&\cong \bigoplus_{|\xi| = d}\GrExt^i_{A}(A/A_{\geq n}, M)_\xi;\\
H^i_{|\m|}(|M|)_d 
  &\cong \bigoplus_{|\xi| = d} H^i_\m(M)_\xi.
\end{align*}
Since the assignation $M \mapsto |M|$ is functorial, we also get that $\pi^n_d = 
\bigoplus_{|\xi| = d} \pi^n_\xi$. Thus for all $\xi$ such
that $|\xi| \geq t$, the map $\pi^n_\xi$ is an isomorphism if $n$ is large enough.
\end{proof}


%\newpage 
\subsection*{Transfer of regularity properties by degeneration}
\label{transfer-of-regularity}
In this subsection we prove that if $A$ has a filtration compatible with its grading, and
the associated graded algebra has property $\chi$, then the regularity properties 
discussed in the previous subsection transfer from $\gr A$ to $A$. 
All undefined terms regarding filtrations can be found in \cite{VO}*{chapter I}.

\paragraph
\label{regular-filtration}
Recall that $A$ denotes a noetherian $\NN^r$-graded algebra.
The general setup for the subsection is as follows: we assume that $A$ has a 
\emph{connected} filtration, that is an exhaustive filtration $\F = \{F_nA\}_{n \geq 
0}$, with $\k = F_0A \subset F_1A \subset \cdots \subset F_nA \subset \cdots 
\bigcup_{n \geq 0} F_nA = A$, such that each layer $F_nA$ is a finite dimensional graded 
vector space, and $F_nA \cdot F_m A \subset F_{n+m}A$ for all $n, m \in \NN$. For each 
$\xi \in \NN^r$ the homogeneous component $A_\xi$ has an induced
filtration $\{F_nA_\xi\}_{n \geq 0}$, where $F_nA_\xi = F_nA \cap A_\xi$. Since
$A_\xi$ is finite dimensional this filtration is finite, so the associated graded ring 
$\gr A$ is a connected and locally finite $\NN^{r+1}$-graded algebra. 

Given any $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module $M$ with a filtration whose layers are 
$\ZZ^r$-graded subspaces, we can construct the $\ZZ^{r+1}$-graded $\gr A$-module $\gr M$.
If $M$ is any $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module then it can be endowed with such a filtration as 
follows: fix a graded subspace $N \subset M$ that generates 
$M$ over $A$, and for each $n \geq 0$ set $F_nM = (F_nA) N$. Any such filtration is 
called \emph{standard}, and is an exhaustive and discrete filtration by graded subspaces.
If $M$ is finitely generated and $N$ is finite dimensional then the layers of this 
filtration are also finite dimensional. 

\paragraph
\label{P:ext-ss} 
The main tool used to transfer homological information from $\gr A$ to $A$ is a 
spectral sequence that we associate to any pair of $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-modules $N, 
M$, which converges to $\GrExt^i_A(N,M)$ and whose first page consists of the 
homogeneous components of $\GrExt^i_{\gr A}(\gr N, \gr M)$. The proof is straightforward, but 
relies on several graded analogues of classical constructions for filtered rings. These
constructions can be found in \cite{VO}*{Chapter I} and \cite{MR}*{Section 7.6}, and the
proofs found in the references easily adapt to the graded context, so we use them
without further comment.

In order to keep track of the extra component in the grading when passing to associated 
graded objects, we make a slight abuse of notation: given a $\ZZ^{r+1}$-graded vector 
space $V$, we denote by $V_{(\xi, p)}$ its homogeneous component of degree $(\xi_1, 
\ldots, \xi_r, p)$.

\begin{Proposition*} 
Suppose that $\gr A$ is noetherian.
Let $M, N$ be filtered $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-modules, with $N$ finitely generated, and
suppose that the filtration on $N$ is standard and the filtration on $M$ is discrete. Then
for every $\xi \in \ZZ^r$ there exists a convergent spectral sequence
\begin{align*} 
  E(N,M)_\xi: E_{p,q}^1 = \GrExt_{\gr A}^{-p-q}(\gr N, \gr M)_{(\xi,p)}
    &\Rightarrow \GrExt_A^{-p-q}(N,M)_\xi 
    &p,q \in \ZZ, 
\end{align*} 
such that the filtration of the vector spaces on the right hand side is finite.
\end{Proposition*}
\begin{proof}
By the $\ZZ^r$-graded version of \cite{MR}*{Theorem 6.17}, there exists a projective
resolution $P^\bullet \to N$ by filtered projective $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-modules with
filtered differentials, such that the associated graded complex $\gr P^\bullet \to \gr N$
is a $\ZZ^{r+1}$-graded projective resolution of the $\gr A$-module $\gr N$.
Using the filtration for the $\GrHom$ spaces defined in \cite{VO}*{section I.2}, the
complex $\GrHom_A(P^\bullet, M)$ is a graded complex with a filtration by graded
subcomplexes, whose differentials are filtered maps.

If we fix $\xi \in \ZZ^r$ the homogeneous component $\GrHom_A(P^\bullet, M)_\xi$ is a 
complex of filtered finite dimensional vector spaces. By \cite{W}*{5.5.1.2} there exists 
a spectral sequence with page one equal to
\begin{align*} 
  E_{p,q}^1 
  &= H_{p+q}\left(\frac{F_p \GrHom_A(P^\bullet,M)_\xi}
      {F_{p-1}  \GrHom_A(P^\bullet,M)_\xi}\right) 
    & p,q \in \ZZ,
\end{align*} 
that converges to   
\begin{align*} 
  H_{p+q}(\GrHom_{A}(P^\bullet,M)_\xi) \cong \GrExt^{-p-q}_A(N,M)_\xi.
\end{align*}
This last space is finite dimensional, and hence the filtration on it is finite. Thus 
we only need to prove that for each $p,q \in \ZZ$ there exists an isomorphism
\begin{align*} 
  H_{p+q}\left(\frac{F_p \GrHom_A(P^\bullet,M)_\xi}{F_{p-1} \GrHom_A(P^\bullet,M)_\xi}
  \right) 
    &\cong \GrExt_{\gr A}^{-p-q}(\gr N, \gr M)_{(\xi,p)}.
\end{align*} 

By \cite{VO}*{Lemma 6.4}, there exists an isomorphism of complexes $\phi(P^\bullet, M):
\gr (\GrHom_A(P^\bullet, M)) \to \GrHom_{\gr A}(\gr P^\bullet, \gr M)$, which is defined
explicitly in the reference. Direct inspection shows that the map $\phi(P^\bullet, M)$ 
is homogeneous, so looking at its component of degree $\xi$ we obtain an isomorphism
\begin{align*}
\frac{F_p \GrHom_A(P^\bullet,M)_\xi}{F_{p-1} \GrHom_A(P^\bullet,M)}_\xi \cong 
\GrHom_{\gr A}(\gr P^\bullet, \gr M)_{(\xi,p)}.
\end{align*}
Since $\gr P^\bullet$ is a $\ZZ^{r+1}$-graded projective resolution of $\gr N$, we obtain
the desired isomorphism by applying $H_{p+q}$ to both sides of the isomorphism.
\end{proof}


\begin{Corollary}
\label{C:consequences-of-ext-ss}
Suppose $\gr A$ is noetherian, and let $M, N$ be as in Proposition \ref{P:ext-ss}.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{I:dims}  For each $i \geq 0$ and each $\xi \in \ZZ^{r}$
    \[
      \dim_\k \GrExt^i_A(N,M)_\xi \leq \sum_{p=-\infty}^\infty \dim_\k \GrExt^i_{\gr
      A}(\gr N, \gr M)_{(\xi, p)}.
    \]
  
  \item \label{I:pd-id} $\pd_A^{\ZZ^r} N \leq \pd_{\gr A}^{\ZZ^{r+1}} \gr N$ and  
    $\id_A^{\ZZ^r} M \leq \id_{\gr A}^{\ZZ^{r+1}} \gr M$. 
  
  \item \label{I:chi} If $\chi(\gr M)$ holds then $\chi(M)$ holds.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Corollary}

\paragraph
\label{ldim} 
We now prove a result that relates the local cohomology of a $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module 
$M$ with that of its associated graded module $\gr M$. We will do this by combining 
Proposition \ref{P:ext-ss} with Lemma \ref{chi-and-local-cohomology} and the formalism
of the change of grading functors introduced in \cite{RZ}*{Section 1.3}. We recall the
relevant details. Given a group morphism $\phi: \ZZ^r \to \ZZ^t$, with $t \in \NN$, 
there exists a functor $\phi_!: \ZZ^r\Mod \k \to \ZZ^t \Mod \k$ that sends a 
$\ZZ^r$-graded vector space $V$ to the $\ZZ^t$-graded vector space $\phi_!(V)$, whose 
homogeneous component of degree $\zeta \in \ZZ^t$ is
\[
  V_\zeta = \bigoplus_{\phi(\xi) = \zeta} V_\xi.
\]
Notice that $\phi_!$ does not change the underlying vector space of its argument, only 
its grading. If $R$ is a $\ZZ^r$-graded algebra then $\phi_!(R)$ is a $\ZZ^t$-graded 
algebra, and if $M$ is a $\ZZ^r$-graded $R$-module then $\phi_!(M)$ is a $\ZZ^t$-graded 
$\phi_!(R)$-module with the same underlying $R$-module structure as $M$.

\begin{Corollary*}
Assume $\gr A$ is noetherian. Let $M$ be a filtered $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module with a
discrete filtration, and assume $\chi(\gr M)$ holds. Then for each $i \geq 0$ and each 
$\xi \in \ZZ^r$ 
  \[
    \dim_\k H^i_\m(M)_\xi \leq \sum_{p=- \infty}^\infty \dim_\k H^i_{\gr \m}(\gr
    M)_{(\xi, p)}.
  \]
\end{Corollary*}
\begin{proof}
Let $\pi: \ZZ^{r+1} \to \ZZ^r$ be the projection to the first $r$-coordinates, and set $B
= \pi_!(\gr A)$, so for every $\xi \in \ZZ^r$
\begin{align*}
B_\xi = \bigoplus_{p \in \ZZ} \gr A_{(\xi, p)} = \gr (A_\xi).
\end{align*}
Thus $B$ is a connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra. Set $\n = \pi_!(\gr \m)$, which is
the maximal graded ideal of $B$, and set $\tilde M = \pi_!(\gr M)$.

By \cite{RZ2}*{Proposition 1.3.7} $\chi(\gr M)$ implies
$\chi(\tilde M)$ and by item \ref{I:chi} of Corollary \ref{C:consequences-of-ext-ss} it 
also implies $\chi(M)$, so we may apply Lemma \ref{chi-and-local-cohomology} to both $M$ 
and $\tilde M$, and deduce that for all $\xi \in \ZZ^r$ and all $i \geq 0$, the natural 
maps 
\begin{align*}
  \GrExt^i_A(A/A_{\geq n}, M)_\xi &\to H^i_\m(M)_\xi;\\
  \GrExt^i_B(B/B_{\geq n}, \tilde M)_\xi &\to H^i_\n( \tilde M)_\xi;
\end{align*}
are isomorphisms for $n \gg 0$.

Combining this with \cite{RZ2}*{Propositions 1.3.7 and 1.3.8}, we obtain a chain of
isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
\bigoplus_{p \in \ZZ} \GrExt^i_{\gr A}&\left(\frac{\gr A}{\gr (A_{\geq n})}, \gr M 
  \right)_{(\xi, p)} \cong \\
  &\cong \GrExt^i_B \left(B/B_{\geq n}, \tilde M \right)_\xi 
  \cong H^i_\n(\tilde M)_\xi 
  \cong \bigoplus_{p \in \ZZ} H^i_{\gr \m}(\gr M)_{(\xi, p)} 
\end{align*}
By definition $\gr(A/A_{\geq n}) \cong \gr A / \gr (A_{\geq n})$, so applying item 
\ref{I:dims} of Corollary \ref{C:consequences-of-ext-ss} and taking $n \gg 0$ we obtain
\begin{align*}
\dim_\k H^i_\m(M)_\xi 
  &= \dim_\k \GrExt^i_A(A/A_{\geq n}, M)_\xi \\
  &\leq \sum_{p = -\infty}^\infty \dim_\k
  \GrExt^i_{\gr A}(\gr A / \gr (A_{\geq n}), M)_{(\xi, p)} \\
  &= \sum_{p = -\infty}^\infty \dim_\k H^i_{\gr \m}(\gr M)_{(\xi, p)}.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

%\paragraph

We are now ready to prove the main result of this section. 
\begin{Theorem}
\label{transfer}
Suppose $A$ is a connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra endowed with a connected 
filtration, and that $\gr A$ is noetherian and has property $\chi$. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A$ has property $\chi$;
\item $\lcd_\m A \leq \lcd_{\gr \m} \gr A$;
\item If $\gr A$ is AS-Cohen-Macaulay, AS-Gorenstein or AS-Regular, so is $A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof}
The hypothesis that $\gr A$ is noetherian implies that $A$ is noetherian \cite{MR}*{1.6.9}. 
If $M$ is any finitely generated $\ZZ^r$-graded $A$-module, we may filter it using the procedure
described in \ref{regular-filtration}. Since $\chi(\gr M)$ holds by hypothesis, item 
\ref{I:chi} of Corollary \ref{C:consequences-of-ext-ss} implies $\chi(M)$ holds, which 
proves that $A$ has property $\chi$. 

Item 2 follows from Corollary \ref{ldim}, as does the fact that if $\gr A$ is
AS-Cohen-Macaulay so is $A$. If $\gr A$ is AS-Gorenstein of injective dimension $n$ and
Gorenstein shift $(\xi, p) \in \ZZ^{r+1}$, the algebra $A$ has injective dimension at 
most $n$ by item \ref{I:pd-id} of Corollary \ref{C:consequences-of-ext-ss}. Also, for 
each $\zeta \in \ZZ^r$ the spectral sequence $E(\k, A)_\zeta$ degenerates at page $1$: 
it is zero if $\zeta \neq -\xi$, while for $\zeta = - \xi$ there is a single, one 
dimensional non-zero entry in the diagonal $-p-q = n$. Hence we obtain vector space
isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
  \GrExt^i_A(\k, A)_\zeta 
    &\cong  \begin{cases}
      \k & \mbox{ if  $\zeta = -\xi$ and $i = n$;} \\
      0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Any such isomorphism is also $A^\opp$-linear, so $A$ is left AS-Gorenstein of injective 
dimension $n$ and Gorenstein shift $\xi$. The same proof applies to show that $A$ is 
right AS-Gorenstein with the same injective dimension and Gorenstein shift, so $A$ is 
AS-Gorenstein. 

Finally, assume that $\gr A$ is AS-regular. Then $A$ is AS-Gorenstein, and item
\ref{I:pd-id} of Corollary \ref{C:consequences-of-ext-ss} implies that it has finite
left and right global dimensions. These dimensions are equal to the left and right 
projective dimensions of $\k$ as $A$-module \cite{RZ2}*{Lemma 2.1.5}, which in turn equal
the left and right injective dimensions of $A$ and hence coincide, so $A$ is AS-regular.
\end{proof}

\section{Quantum affine toric degenerations}
\label{qatv}
In this section we recall the homological properties of quantum affine toric varieties
proved in \cite{RZ2}, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for a connected 
$\NN^r$-graded algebra $A$ to have a connected filtration such that the associated 
graded ring is a quantum positive affine toric variety. 

\subsection*{Quantum affine toric varieties}

\paragraph
\label{affine-semigroups}
Recall that an affine semigroup is a finitely generated monoid isomorphic to a 
subsemigroup of $\ZZ^r$ for some $r \in \NN$. An embedding of $S$ is an injective 
semigroup morphism $i: S \hookrightarrow \ZZ^r$ for some $r \in \NN$. By definition, 
every affine semigroup $S$ is commutative and cancellative, so it has a group of
fractions, which we denote by $G(S)$, and the natural map from $S$ to $G(S)$ is
injective. The group $G(S)$ is a finitely generated and torsion-free commutative 
group, so there exists a natural number $r$ such that $G(S) \cong \ZZ^r$ as 
groups; we refer to $r$ as the \emph{rank} of $S$ and denote it $\rk S$. We say that 
$i$ is a \emph{full embedding} if the image of $S$ generates $\ZZ^r$ as a group, in 
which case $r = \rank S$. Fixing an isomorphism $G(S) \cong \ZZ^{\rank(S)}$ we 
obtain a full embedding of $S$ in an obvious way. 

\paragraph
\label{interior}
Let $S$ be an affine semigroup. Fixing an embedding $i: S \hookrightarrow \ZZ^r$ 
we identify $S$ with its image and see $\ZZ^r$ 
as a subgroup of $\RR^r$ in the obvious way. The \emph{rational cone} generated 
by $S$ in $\RR^r$ is the set 
\[
  \RR_+S 
    = \left\{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i s_i \mid r_i \in \RR_{\geq 0}, 
              s_i \in S, n \in \NN\right\}.
\]
The \emph{real interior} of $S$ is defined as $\relint S = S \cap \RR_+S^\circ$, where 
$\RR_+S^\circ$ is the topological interior of $\RR_+ S$ as a subset of the vector space 
$\RR S$ endowed with the subspace topology induced from $\RR^r$. The relative interior 
is intrinsic to $S$ and does not depend on the chosen embedding 
\cite{BG}*{Remark 2.6}.

An affine semigroup $S$ of rank $r$ is called \emph{normal} if it verifies the following 
property: given $z \in G(S)$, if there exists $m \in \NN^*$ such that $mz \in S$, then 
$z \in S$. If we identify $S$ with a subset of $\ZZ^r$ through a full embedding and 
consider the real cone $\RR_+ S$ of $S$ inside $\RR^r$ in the obvious way, then Gordan's 
lemma \cite{BH}*{Proposition 6.1.2} states that $S$ is normal if and only if $S = \ZZ^r 
\cap \RR_+S$.

\paragraph
\label{hilbert-basis}
Let $S$ be an affine semigroup. An element $s \in S$ is called \emph{irreducible} if
whenever $s = x + y$ with $x,y \in S$, the elements $x$ and $y$ are invertible. 
On the other hand $S$ is called \emph{positive} if its only invertible element is 
$0$. If $S$ is positive then the set of its irreducible elements is finite and 
generates $S$; for this reason it is called the \emph{Hilbert 
basis} of $S$. The fact that $S$ is positive also implies that there 
exists a full embedding $S \hookrightarrow \ZZ^r$ such that the image of $S$ is
contained in $\NN^r$. It follows that a semigroup is positive if and only if there
exists $r \geq 0$ such that $S$ is isomorphic to a finitely generated subsemigroup
of $\NN^r$. Proofs of these results can be found in \cite{BG}*{pp. 54--56}. 

\paragraph
\label{presentation}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup and let $\{s_1, \ldots, s_n\}$ be its Hilbert 
Basis. We denote by $\pi: \NN^n \to S$ the semigroup morphism defined by the 
assignation $e_i \mapsto s_i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$, where $e_i$ is the $i$-th 
element in the canonical basis of $\NN^n$. This map determines an equivalence 
relation in $\NN^n$ where $p \sim p'$ if and only if $\pi(p) = \pi(p')$; we denote 
this relation by $L(\pi)$. Clearly $L(\pi)$ is compatible with the additive structure of
$\NN^n$, and hence the quotient $\NN^n / L(\pi)$ is a commutative monoid with 
the operation induced by addition in $\NN^n$, and there is an isomorphism of monoids 
$\NN^n/L(\pi) \cong S$. 

In general, an equivalence relation on $\NN^n$ closed under addition is called a
\emph{congruence}. If $\rho$ is a subset of $\NN^n \times \NN^n$ then the congruence
generated by $\rho$ is the smallest congruence containing the set $\rho$. Redei's 
theorem \cite{RGS}*{Theorem 5.12} states that every congruence in $\NN^n$ is finitely 
generated, i.e. there exists a finite set $\rho \subset \NN^n \times \NN^n$ that 
generates it; in particular there exists a finite set $P =  \{(p_1, p'_1), \ldots, 
(p_m,p'_m) \} \subset L(\pi)$ which generates $L(\pi)$. A \emph{presentation} of $S$ 
will be for us a pair $(\pi, P)$, where $\pi: \NN^n \to S$ is the map described above 
and $P$ is a finite generating set of the congruence $L(\pi)$. By the previous 
discussion every positive affine semigroup has a presentation.

\paragraph
\label{twisted-semigroup-algebras}
Let $S$ be a commutative semigroup.
A $2$-cocycle over $S$ is a function $\alpha: S \times S \to \k^\times$ such that $\alpha
(s,s') \alpha(s+s',s'') = \alpha(s,s'+s'')\alpha(s',s'')$ for all $s,s',s'' \in S$. 
Given a $2$-cocycle $\alpha$ over $S$, the \emph{$\alpha$-twisted semigroup algebra} 
$\k^\alpha[S]$ is the associative $\k$-algebra whose underlying vector space has basis 
$\{X^s \mid s \in S\}$ and whose product over these generators is given by 
$X^s X^t = \alpha(s,t)X^{s+t}$. This is a noncommutative deformation of the classical 
semigroup algebra $\k[S]$. 

\begin{Definition*}
Let $A$ be a connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra. We say that $A$ is a 
\emph{quantum positive affine toric variety} if there exist a positive affine semigroup
$S$ and a $2$-cocycle $\alpha$ over $S$ such that $A$ is isomorphic to the twisted 
semigroup algebra $\k^\alpha[S]$, and for each $s \in S \setminus \{0\}$ the element
$X^s$ is homogeneous of nonzero degree with respect to the $\NN^r$-grading of 
$\k^\alpha[S]$ induced by this isomorphism. In that case we refer to $S$ as the
underlying semigroup of $A$.
\end{Definition*}

Let $r \geq 1$ and let $\psi: S \to \NN^r$ be a monoid morphism such that 
$\psi^{-1}(0) = \{0\}$. The twisted semigroup algebra $\k^\alpha[S]$ can be
endowed with a connected $\NN^r$-grading setting $\deg X^s = \psi(s)$ for each
$s \in S$. Conversely, any connected grading such that the elements of the form 
$X^s$ are homogeneous arises in this manner. In particular, if $A$ is a quantum
positive toric variety with underlying semigroup $S$ then there is a corresponding
monoid morphism $\psi: S \to \NN^r$, to which we will refer as the \emph{grading}
morphism. 

\paragraph
\label{properties-of-qatv}
Quantum positive affine toric varieties were studied from the point of view of noncommutative 
geometry in \cite{RZ2}*{section 3}. The following is a summary of the results proved there.
\begin{Proposition*}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup and let $A$ be a positive quantum toric variety 
with underlying semigroup $S$. Then the following hold.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item $A$ is noetherian and integral.
  \item $A$ has property $\chi$ and finite local dimension equal to the rank of $S$.
  \item Suppose $S$ is normal. Then $A$ is AS-Cohen-Macaulay and a maximal order in its 
    division ring of fractions. Furthermore, $A$ is AS-Gorenstein if and only if
    there exists $s \in S$ such that $\relint S = s + S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Proposition*}
\begin{proof}
This is proved in \cite{RZ2}*{section 3.2} in the case where the grading morphism $\psi$ 
is given by a full embedding of $S$ in $\NN^r$ for some $r \geq 0$. The proposition 
follows from the fact that all the properties mentioned in it are independent of the 
grading, see paragraph \ref{invariance-by-grading}.
\end{proof}

\subsection*{Algebras with a quantum toric degeneration}
%\label{algebras-with-qatd}
Classically, a toric degeneration of an algebraic variety $V$ is a flat deformation
of $V$ into a toric variety $T$. Since varieties inherit many good properties from
their flat deformations, and positive affine toric varieties are well studied, 
toric degeneration are a standard method to study algebraic varieties. With this
in mind we introduce a noncommutative analogue of toric degeneration.  
\begin{Definition}
Let $A$ be a noetherian and connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra. We will say that $A$
has a \emph{quantum positive affine toric degeneration} if it has a connected filtration such 
that its associated graded ring is a quantum positive affine toric variety. We refer 
to the underlying semigroup of this quantum positive affine toric variety as the semigroup 
associated to the degeneration.
\end{Definition}
For the sake of brevity we will write ``quantum toric degeneration'', ommiting the 
adjectives ``positive affine''.
In view of Theorem \ref{transfer} and Proposition \ref{twisted-semigroup-algebras}, 
an algebra with a quantum toric degeneration is noetherian, integral, has property 
$\chi$ and finite local dimension. Furthermore, we can determine whether $A$ is 
AS-Cohen-Macualay or AS-Gorenstein by studying the semigroup associated to the 
degeneration.

\paragraph
\label{s-phi-type}
A standard technique for proving toric degeneration of a variety is to find the 
structure of a Hodge algebra in the coordinate ring of the variety. We now introduce
a noncommutative notion, inspired in the definition of Hodge algebras and its 
descendants such as classical and quantum algebras with a straightening law, which 
will play a similar role for the rest of this article.

\begin{Definition*}
Let $A$ be a noetherian connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra. Let $S$ be a positive affine
semigroup and let $(\pi, P)$ be a presentation of $S$ as defined in \ref{presentation},
with $P = \{(p_i,p'_i) \mid 1 \leq i \leq m\}$. Let $\phi:~S~\to~\NN$ be a semigroup 
morphism such that $\phi^{-1}(0) = \{0\}$, and set $\tphi = \phi \circ \pi$.  

We say that the algebra $A$ is of $(S, \phi)$-type with respect to $(\pi, P)$
if the following hold. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{generation}
$A$ is generated as algebra by a finite set of homogeneous elements $\{b_1, 
\ldots, b_n\}$ of the same cardinality as the Hilbert basis of $S$. We set
$\b^\xi = \displaystyle \prod_{i = 1}^n b_i^{\xi_i}$ for each $\xi \in \NN^n$.

\item \label{commutation}
For each $1 \leq i < j \leq n$ and each $\xi \in \NN^n$ such that $\tphi(\xi) < 
\phi(s_i + s_j)$, there exist $c_{i,j} \in \k^\times$ and $c^{i,j}_\xi \in \k$ such that
\begin{align*}
  b_j b_i = c_{i,j} b_i b_j + \sum_{\tphi(\xi) < \phi(s_i + s_j)} c^{i,j}_\xi
    \b^\xi.
\end{align*}

\item \label{straightening}
For each $1 \leq i \leq m$ and each $\xi \in \NN^n$ such that $\tphi(\xi) <
\tphi(p_i)$ there exist $d_i \in \k^\times$ and $d^i_\xi \in \k$ such that
    \begin{align*}
      \b^{p'_i} = d_i \b^{p_i} + \sum_{\tphi(\xi) < \tphi(p_i)} d^i_\xi \b^\xi.
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}
We say that $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type if there exists a presentation of $S$
such that $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type with respect to it.
\end{Definition*}

\begin{Remark*}
Since $\tphi(e_i) = \phi(s_i) > 0$ for all $i$, given $l \in \NN$ there exist 
finitely many $\xi \in \NN^n$ such that $\tphi(\xi) \leq l$ and so the sums on the 
right hand side of the formulas displayed in \ref{commutation} and \ref{straightening} 
are finite.
\end{Remark*}

\paragraph
\label{type-filtration}
If $A$ is an algebra of $(S,\phi)$-type we write $F_lA = \langle \b^\xi \mid \tphi(\xi)
\leq l \rangle$ for each $l \in \NN$. The fact that $\tphi(e_i) > 0$ for all $i$ 
implies that this is a finite dimensional vector space, and that $F_0A = \k$. The 
following lemma shows that $\F = \{F_lA\}_{l \geq 0}$ is a connected filtration on $A$.

\begin{Lemma*}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup.
Let $A$ be a noetherian connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra, and assume that it is of
$(S, \phi)$-type with respect to a presentation $(\pi, P)$. Then the following hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{filtration}
Given $\xi, \nu \in \NN^n$ there exists $c_{\xi, \nu} \in \k^\times$ such that $\b^\xi
\b^\nu \equiv c_{\xi, \nu}\b^{\xi + \nu} \mod F_{\tphi(\xi + \nu) - 1}A$. In particular 
$\F$ is a filtration on $A$.

\item \label{straight}
Given $(\xi, \nu) \in L(\pi)$ there exists $d_{\xi, \nu} 
\in \k^\times$ such that $\b^\xi \equiv d_{\xi, \nu} \b^\nu \mod F_{\tphi(\xi) - 1} A$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Lemma*}
\begin{proof}
To prove item \ref{filtration} we proceed by induction on $\tphi(\xi + \nu)$, with the
$0$-th step being obvious since $F_0A = \k$ is a subalgebra of $A$. Suppose that the
result holds for all $l < \tphi(\xi + \nu)$ and let $i$ be the least integer such that
$\xi_i \neq 0$, so $\b^\xi \b^\nu = b_i (\b^{\xi - e_i} \b ^\nu)$. Using the inductive
hypothesis we obtain
\begin{align*}
b_i (\b^{\xi - e_i} \b^\nu) 
&= b_i \bigg( c_{\xi- e_i, \nu} \b^{\xi - e_i + \nu} 
  + \sum_{\tphi(\rho) < \tphi(\xi - e_i + \nu)} c_\rho \b^\rho \bigg)\\
&= c_{\xi- e_i, \nu} b_i \b^{\xi - e_i + \nu} 
  + \sum_{\tphi(\rho) < \tphi(\xi - e_i + \nu)} c_\rho b_i \b^\rho
\end{align*}
where the $c_\rho \in \k$ and $c_{\xi - e_i,\nu} \in \k^\times$. The inductive  
hypothesis also implies each product $b_i \b^\rho$ lies in $F_{\tphi(\xi + \nu) -1} A$,
so
\[
  b_i \b^{\xi - e_i} \b^\nu \equiv c_{\xi- e_i, \nu}b_i \b^{\xi - e_i + \nu} \mod
  F_{\tphi(\xi + \nu)-1}A.
\]
Now let $j$ be the least integer such that $\nu_j \neq 0$. If $i \leq j$ then $b_i 
\b^{\xi - e_i + \nu} = \b^{\xi + \nu}$ and we are finished; otherwise, using item 2 of 
Definition \ref{s-phi-type} and a similar argument as before, we obtain
\begin{align*}
  b_i \b^{\xi - e_i + \nu} = (b_i b_j)(\b^{\xi - e_i + \nu - e_j}) \equiv c_{j,i} (b_j
  b_i)(\b^{\xi - e_i + \nu - e_j}) \mod F_{\tphi(\xi + \nu) - 1}A
\end{align*}
The same reasoning applied to the product $b_j(b_i\b^{\xi - e_i + \nu - e_j})$ shows that
\begin{align*}
  b_j (b_i \b^{\xi - e_i + \nu - e_j}) 
    &\equiv c_{e_i, \xi - e_i + \nu - e_j} b_j(\b^{\xi  + \nu - e_j}) \mod
  F_{\tphi(\xi + \nu) - 1}A.
\end{align*}
Since $j < i$, the definition of $j$ implies $b_j(\b^{\xi  + \nu - e_j}) = \b^{\xi + 
\nu}$, so the proof of item \ref{filtration} is complete.

We now prove item \ref{straight}. Set
\[
  T = \{(\xi, \nu) \in L(\pi) \mid \b^\xi \equiv c \b^{\nu} \mod
    F_{\tphi(\xi) -1}
    \mbox{ for some } c \in \k^\times\}.
\]
We will show that $L(\pi) \subset T$, which clearly implies the desired result.
By definition $T$ is an equivalence relation, and item \ref{filtration} implies it is a
congruence on $\NN^n$. By item \ref{straightening} of Definition \ref{s-phi-type}, 
every pair $(p_i, p'_i) \in P$ lies in $T$. Since $L(\pi)$ is the smallest congruence 
containing $P$, we deduce that $L(\pi) \subset T$.
\end{proof}

\label{P:equivalent-qatd}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup and let $(\pi, P)$ be a presentation of $S$.
A \emph{section} of $\pi$ is a function $\tau: S \to \NN^n$ such that $\pi \circ \tau =
\Id_S$, that is $s = \sum_i \tau(s)_i s_i$ for every $s \in S$. If $A$ is an algebra of
$(S,\phi)$-type then Lemma \ref{type-filtration} implies that for any section $\tau$ of
$\pi$ the set $\{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ spans $A$. We now show that an algebra has 
a quantum toric degeneration if and only if it is of $(S,\phi)$-type for an 
adequate morphism $\phi$ and the spanning set determined by any section is linearly 
independent.
\begin{Proposition*}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup, and let $A$ be a noetherian connected 
$\NN^r$-graded algebra. The following statements are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{has-qat-degeneration}
The algebra $A$ has a quantum toric degeneration with associated semigroup $S$.

\item \label{every-section}
For every presentation $(\pi, P)$ of $S$ there exists a semigroup morphism 
$\phi: S \to \NN$ such that $A$ is of $(S, \phi)$-type with respect to $(\pi, P)$, 
and for every section $\tau: S \to \NN^n$ of $\pi$ the set $\{
\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ is linearly independent.

\item \label{some-section}
There exist a presentation $(\pi, P)$, a semigroup morphism $\phi: S \to \NN$ 
and a section $\tau: S \to \NN^n$ of $\pi$ such that $A$ is of $(S, \phi)$-type 
with respect to $(\pi, P)$ and the set $\{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ is 
linearly independent.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Proposition*}
\begin{proof}
We first show that \ref{has-qat-degeneration} implies \ref{every-section}. By hypohtesis
there exists a filtration by graded subspaces $\F = \{F_lA\}_{l \geq 0}$ such that 
$\gr_\F A \cong \k^\alpha[S]$ as $\NN^{r+1}$-graded algebras for some $2$-cocycle 
$\alpha: S \times S \to \k^\times$, with the grading on the twisted semigroup algebra 
given by a semigroup morphism $\psi: S \to \NN^{r+1}$ such that $\psi^{-1}(0) = \{0\}$. 
We  identify $\gr_\F A$ with $\k^\alpha[S]$ through this isomorphism to simplify notation. 

Fix a presentation $(\pi, P)$ of $S$.
For each $1 \leq i \leq n$ we choose homogeneous elements $b_i \in A$ such that 
$\gr b_i = X^{s_i}$. By definition of the product of an associated graded ring, for each 
$\xi \in \NN^n$ the element $\prod_{i = 1}^n (\gr b_i)^{\xi_i}$ equals either 
$\gr \left(\prod_{i = 1}^n b_i^{\xi_i}\right)$ or zero. Since $\k^\alpha[S]$ is an
integral ring the last possibility cannot occur, so $\gr (\b^\xi)$ equals a nonzero 
multiple of $X^{\pi(\xi)}$. Thus if $\tau: S \to \NN^n$ is a section of $\pi$ then for
each $s \in S$ there exists a nonzero constant $c_s$ such that $\gr b^{\tau(s)}
\equiv c_s X^s$, and so the set $\{\gr \b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ is a basis of 
$\k^\alpha[S]$, which implies that $\{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ is a basis of $A$. 
This also proves that $A$ satisfies item \ref{generation} of Definition \ref{s-phi-type}.

Let $\phi: S \to \NN$ be the additive map given by $s \mapsto \psi(s)_{r+1}$; 
equivalently $\phi(s)$ is the minimal $l$ such that $\b^\xi \in F_l A$ for all $\xi 
\in \pi^{-1}(s)$. In particular $\phi(s_i) > 0$ since $F_0A = \k$. Also $F_lA = 
\vspan{\b^\xi \mid \tphi(\xi) \leq l}$, and since for each $\xi \in \NN^n$ there exists 
a nonzero constant $c_\xi$ such that $\gr b^\xi \equiv c_\xi \gr b^{\tau(\pi(\xi))}$ we 
actually have $F_lA = \vspan{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid \phi(s) \leq l}$. Finally, for each $1 
\leq i,j \leq n$ and each $1 \leq k \leq m$ there exist $c_{i,j}, d_k \in \k^\times$ 
such that
\begin{align*}
  \gr (b_j b_i) &= c_{i,j} \gr (b_i b_j),\\
  \gr \b^{p'_k} &= d_k \gr \b^{p_k}
\end{align*}
hold in $\gr_\F A$, which implies that items \ref{commutation} and 
\ref{straightening} of Definition \ref{s-phi-type} hold in $A$ for the morphism
$\phi$ we have just defined. Thus $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type, and we have proved 
\ref{has-qat-degeneration} implies \ref{every-section}.

We said in \ref{presentation} that every positive affine semigroup has a presentation
so clearly \ref{every-section} implies \ref{some-section}. Let us see that
\ref{some-section} implies \ref{has-qat-degeneration}. Define the filtration 
$\F = \{F_l A\}_{l \geq 0}$ as in \ref{type-filtration}. By item 2 of Lemma 
\ref{type-filtration}, the set $\{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid \phi(s) \leq l\}$ generates $F_lA$
for each $l \in \NN$, and since by hypothesis it is linearly independent, it is a 
basis of $F_lA$. Hence $\gr_\F A$ is generated by $\{\gr \b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$. 
Once again by Lemma \ref{type-filtration} for each $s,s' \in S$ there exist 
$\beta(s,s'), \alpha(s,s') \in \k^\times$ such that
\begin{align*}
(\gr \b^{\tau(s)})(\gr \b^{\tau(s')}) = \beta(s,s') \gr \b^{\tau(s) + \tau(s')} = 
\alpha(s,s') \gr \b^{\tau(s+s')}.
\end{align*}
Associativity of the product of $\gr_\F A$ implies that $\alpha: S \times S \to 
\k^\times$ is a $2$-coycle, so we may consider the $\k$-linear map $\k^\alpha[S] \to 
\gr_\F A$ induced by the assignation $X^s \mapsto \gr \b^{\tau(s)}$, which is a 
multiplicative map. Since $S$ is positive we must have $\tau(0) = 0$, and hence 
$\alpha(s,0) = \alpha(0,s) = 1$ for all $s \in S$ which implies that our 
multiplicative map is unitaty and hence an isomorphism of $\k$-algebras. 
Furthermore, the elements $\gr \b^{\tau(s)}$ are homogeneous, so this algebra is 
indeed a quantum positive affine toric variety.
\end{proof}

\paragraph
\label{lex-degeneration}
We now introduce a second notion related to quantum toric degenerations. Recall that a
semigroup $S$ is said to be well-ordered if there exists a well-order $<$ on $S$
compatible with the additive structure, i.e. such that for all $s,s',s'' \in S$ the 
inequality $s<s'$ implies $s+s'' < s'+s''$. 

\begin{Definition*}
Let $S$ be a semigroup, and let $<$ be a well-order on $S$ compatible 
with the semigroup structure. Let $A$ be a connected $\NN^r$-graded algebra. 
An \emph{$(S,<)$-basis} for $A$ is an ordered basis $\{b_s \mid s \in S\}$ consisting 
of homogeneous elements, such that for all $s,s',s'' \in S$ with $s'' < s+s'$ there exist 
$c_{s,s'} \in \k^\times$ and $c_{s,s'}^{s''} \in \k$ such that
\[
  b_s b_{s'} = c_{s,s'} b_{s+s'} + \sum_{s'' < s+s'} c_{s,s'}^{s''} b_{s''}.
\]
\end{Definition*}
This definition is inspired in the results of \cite{C}, where P. Caldero finds
an $(S,<)$-basis for quantum flag varieties for appropriate $S$ and $<$.

\paragraph
Let $S$ be a semigroup. Assume $<$ is a well-order on $S$ compatible with its additive structure, 
and let $A$ be
an algebra. An $(S,<)$-filtration on $A$ is a collection of vector spaces $\F = \{F_sA \mid s 
\in S\}$, such that $F_sA \cdot F_{s'} A \subset F_{s+s'}A$ for all $s,s' \in S$, and such that
$F_sA \subset F_{s'}A$ whenever $s < s'$. The standard notions related to $\NN$-filtrations
translate easily to the context of $(S,<)$-filtrations. In particular, one can define the 
associated graded algebra $\gr_\F A$ by setting $F_{<s}A = \sum_{t<s} F_tA$ and taking
\[
\gr_\F A = \bigoplus_{s \in S} \frac{F_sA}{F_{<s}A}.
\] 
As usual, for each element $a \in A$ we may define $\gr a$ as the image of $a$ in the 
quotient $F_sA / F_{<s}A$ where $s$ is the first element of $S$ such that $a \in F_sA$;
notice that this element exists because $<$ is a well-order. The product can then be 
defined as in the $\NN$-filtered case, namely if $a,b \in A$ and $s,t$ are minimal 
elements such that $a \in F_sA, b \in F_tA$, then $(\gr a)(\gr b)$ equals the image of 
$ab$ in $F_{s+t}A / F_{<s+t}A$, which equals $\gr(ab)$ if $t+s$ is minimal with respect 
to the property that $ab \in F_{t+s}A$ and zero otherwise.

We now describe a mechanism to obtain well-orders on positive affine 
semigroups. Since $S$
is a positive affine semigroup it can be embedded in $\NN^r$ for some $r \geq 0$ through 
a monoid morphism $\iota: S \to \NN^r$. Now $\NN^r$ is a well-ordered semigroup with
the lexicographic order, which is compatible with its additive structure, so we may
pull-back the lexicographic order thourgh $\iota$ and thus obtain a well-order $<^\iota$
over $S$, which is also compatible with its additive structure. Notice that in this case
$0$ is always the minimal element of $S$.

\begin{Lemma*}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup, let $\iota: S \to \NN^r$ be an embedding, and 
let $< = <^\iota$ be the pull-back of the lexicographic order on $S$.
Let $A$ be a noetherian $\NN^r$-graded connected algebra, and assume it has an $(S,<)$-
basis $\B = \{b_s \mid s \in S\}$. Set $F_sA = \langle b_t \mid t \leq s \in S \rangle$
and $\F = \{F_sA \mid s \in S\}$. Also let $\{s_1, \ldots, s_n\}$ be the Hilbert basis of $S$
and set $b_i = b_{s_i}$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. The following hold.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The family $\F$ is an exhaustive $(S,<)$-filtration. Furthermore,
each quotient $F_sA / F_{<s}A$ is of dimension $1$ and $F_0A = \langle 1 \rangle$.

\item There exists a $2$-cocycle $\alpha$ over $S$ such that $\gr_\F A$ is isomorphic as 
$S$-graded algebra to $\k^\alpha[S]$.

\item The algebra $A$ is generated by the set $\{b_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq n\}$.
\end{enumerate} 
\end{Lemma*}
\begin{proof}
The fact that $\F$ is an exhaustive $(S,<)$-filtration is an immediate consequence of the 
defintion of an $(S,<)$-basis. Also $F_{<s}A = \langle b_t \mid t < s\rangle$, so $F_sA / 
F_{<s}A$ is generated
by the image of $b_s$ in the quotient. Finally, writing $1$ as a linear combination of the $b_s$
and using a leading term argument, it is easy to see that $1 \in F_0A$ and hence it must generate
it. Notice that this implies that $b_0$ is a scalar, and without loss of generality we may assume
that $b_0 = 1$.

Set $\alpha(s,s') = c_{s,s'}$ for each $s,s' \in S$. By item $1$, the set $\{\gr b_s \mid s \in 
S\}$ is a basis of $\gr_\F A$, and by definition of the product on the associated graded ring
$(\gr b_s) (\gr b_{s'}) = c_{s,s'} \gr b_{s+s'}$. Associativity of the product in $\gr_\F A$
implies then that $\alpha$ is a $2$-cocycle over $S$, and furthermore the map $\gr_\F A \to 
\k^\alpha[S]$ sending $\gr b_s$ to $X^s$ is a multiplicative $S$-graded vector-space isomorphism.
Since we are assuming that $b_0 = 1$, it follows that $\alpha(1,s) = \alpha(s,1) = 1$ for all 
$s \in S$ and hence our isomorphism preserves the unit, and is thus a ring isomorphism.
This proves item 2.

Finally, in order to prove that the $b_i$'s generate $A$ it is enough to show that each $b_s$
is in the algebra generated by these elements. Suppose this is not the case. Then, since $S$ is 
well-ordered by $<$, there exists a minimal $s$ such that $b_s$ is not in the algebra
generated by the $b_i$'s. Take $\xi \in \NN^r$ such that $\pi(\xi) = s$. By the definition of 
the product of the associated graded ring, $\prod_i(\gr b_i)^{\xi_i}$ equals either $\gr 
(\b^\xi)$ or zero, and since $\gr_\F A \cong \k^\alpha[S]$ is integral the second possibility 
can not occur. Thus $\gr(\b^\xi)$ is a nonzero element of $\gr_\F A$ of degree $\pi(\xi)$,
so item 1 of this lemma implies that $\gr b_s = c\gr(\b^\xi)$ for some $c \in \k^\times$, and 
hence $b_s  = c\b^\xi + \sum_{t<s} c_t b_t$. By the minimality of $s$ all the $b_t$'s appearing
in the sum on the right hand side of the equation lie in the algebra generated by the $b_i$'s,
and clearly so does $\b^\xi$, a contradiction. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Proposition*}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup, and let $A$ be a noetherian connected 
$\NN^r$-graded algebra.
The algebra $A$ has a quantum affine toric degeneration with underlying semigroup $S$ if 
and only if there exists an embedding $\iota: S \to \NN^t$ such that $A$ has an 
ordered $(S, <^\iota)$-basis.
\end{Proposition*}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $A$ has a quantum affine toric degeneration with underlying semigroup $S$. Then 
by Proposition \ref{P:equivalent-qatd} there exists a semigroup morphism $\phi:S\to 
\NN$ such that $A$ is of $(S, \phi)$-type, and we may choose any section $\tau: S \to 
\NN^n$ to obtain a basis $\mathcal B = \{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$. Let $\rho: S \to 
\NN^{t}$ be an embedding and let $\iota: S \to \NN^{t+1}$ be defined as $\iota(s) = 
(\phi(s), \rho(s))$, which is an embedding of $S$ since $\rho$ is an embedding. Write $<$ 
for $<^\iota$, and notice that $\phi(s) < \phi(s')$ implies $s<s'$. By Lemma 
\ref{type-filtration}, for all $s,s' \in S$ and all $s''$ such that $\phi(s'') < 
\phi(s+s')$ there exist $c_{s,s'} \in \k^\times$ and $c_{s,s'}^{s''} \in \k$ such that
\[
  \b^{\tau(s)}\b^{\tau(s')} 
    = c_{s,s'}\b^{\tau(s+s')} 
      + \sum_{\phi(s'') < \phi(s+s')} c_{s,s'}^{s''} \b^{\tau(s'')},
\]
which implies $\mathcal B$ is an ordered $S$-basis with respect to $<$.

Now assume $A$ has an ordered $S$-basis with respect to some total order $<$ induced 
by an embedding $\iota: S \to \NN^t$. Since $<$ is the pull-back of the lexicographic 
order through an embedding, we might as well assume $S \subset \NN^t$ and that $<$ is 
the lexicographic order. By the previous lemma, we already know that the $b_i$'s 
generate $A$, so all that is left to do is to prove the existence of an additive
map $\phi:S \to \NN$ and that of the desired relations.

Recall that using the $(S,<)$-filtration $\F$ defined in the previous lemma, we 
proved that $\gr_\F A \cong \k^\alpha[S]$ for some $2$-cocycle $S$. This implies that 
for all $1 \leq i < j \leq n$ and all $\xi \in \NN^n$ 
such that $\pi(\xi) < s_i +s_j$ there exist $c_{i,j} \in \k^\times$ and $c^{i,j}_\xi \in 
\k$ such that
\begin{align*}
  b_j b_i = c_{i,j} b_i b_j + \sum_{\pi(\xi) < \pi(s_i + s_j)} c^{i,j}_\xi
    \b^\xi,
\end{align*}
and for each $1 \leq i \leq m$ and each $\xi \in \NN^n$ such that $\pi(\xi) < p_i$ 
there exist $d_i \in \k^\times$ and $d^i_\xi \in \k$ such that
\begin{align*}
  \b^{p'_i} = d_i \b^{p_i} + \sum_{\pi(\xi) < p} d^i_\xi \b^\xi.
\end{align*}
Let $C \subset S$ be the set consisting of the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item all $s_i + s_j$ with $1 \leq i<j\leq n$;
\item all $\pi(p_i)$ with $1 \leq i \leq m$;
\item all $\pi(\xi)$ such that $c^{i,j}_\xi \neq 0$ for some $1 \leq i < j \leq n$;
\item and all $\pi(\xi)$ such that $d^i_\xi \neq 0$ for some $1 \leq i \leq m$.
\end{itemize}  
The set $C$ is finite and hence is contained in a cube $[0,N+1]^t$ for $N$ large enough, 
so the morphism $\phi: \NN^t \to \NN$ mapping $e_i$ to $(N+1)^i$ sends each $c \in C$ to 
the natural number having $N+1$-adic expansion $c$. In particular $\phi$ respects the 
restriction of the lexicographic order to $C$, and thus $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type. 

Let $\tau: S \to \NN^n$ be any section of $\pi$. The algebra $\gr_\F A$ has a natural 
$S$-grading, and for each $s \in S$ the element $\gr \b^{\tau(s)}$ is of degree $s$. As 
we have already observed, this is a non-zero element so the set $\{\gr \b^{\tau(s)} \mid 
s \in S\}$ is a basis of $\gr_\F A$, which implies that $\{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ 
is a basis of $A$. Thus by Proposition \ref{P:equivalent-qatd} $A$ has a quantum affine 
toric degeneration with underlying semigroup $S$.
\end{proof}

\begin{Remark*}
The trick of turning the $S$-filtration into an $\NN$-filtration using $N+1$-adic 
expansions is due to Caldero \cite{C}*{Lemma 3.2}. A similar though less general
version of this idea appears in \cite{GL} and \cite{RZ}.
\end{Remark*}

\paragraph
We finish this section with an easy consequence of Lemma \ref{type-filtration}. It will
not be used in the sequel, but we include it for completeness.
\begin{Proposition*}
Let $S$ be a positive affine semigroup and $A$ a noetherian connected $\NN^r$-graded
algebra. If $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type for some monoid morphism $\phi: S \to \NN$, and 
there exists some section $\tau$ of $\pi$ such that the set $\{\b^{\tau(s)} \mid s 
\in S\}$ is linearly independent, then the relations given in
items \ref{commutation} and \ref{straightening} of Definition \ref{s-phi-type} give a
presentation of $A$.
\end{Proposition*}
\begin{proof}
Since $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type, it is generated as algebra by homogeneous elements 
$b_1, \ldots, b_n$, and there exist constants $c_{i,j}, c^{i,j}_\xi, d_i, d^i_\xi$ such
that $A$ complies with Definition \ref{s-phi-type}. Furthermore, the relations described 
in items \ref{commutation} and \ref{straightening} of this definition are homogeneous.

Let $B$ be the free algebra generated by $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ and let $I$ be the ideal of
$B$ generated by the elements
\begin{align*}
  X_j X_i &- c_{i,j} X_i X_j - \sum_{\tphi(\xi) < \phi(s_i + s_j)} c^{i,j}_\xi
  X^\xi, 
    & \mbox{for } 1 \leq i < j \leq n;\\
  X^{p'_i} &- d_i X^{p_i} - \sum_{\tphi(\xi) < \tphi(p_i)} d^i_\xi X^\xi, 
    &\mbox{for } 1 \leq i \leq m;
\end{align*}
where $X^\xi = X_1^{\xi_1} X_2^{\xi_2} \cdots X_n^{\xi_n}$ for each $\xi \in \NN^n$. 
We put an $\NN^r$ grading on $B$ by setting $\deg X_i = \deg b_i$, and this induces
an $\NN^r$ grading on $B/I$. Since $B$ is a free algebra the assignation $X_i \mapsto 
b_i$ induces a morphism of graded algebras $B \to A$, which factors through $B/I$. We 
thus obtain a morphism of $\NN^r$-graded algebras $f: B/I \to A$.

We denote by $Y_i$ the image of $X_i$ in $B/I$. Cleary $B/I$ is an $(S,\phi)$-algebra, 
and the algebra map $f: B/I \to A$ sends $Y_i$ to $b_i$ for all $i$. Since 
$f(Y^{\tau(s)}) = \b^{\tau(s)}$, the set $\{Y^{\tau(s)} \mid s \in S\}$ is linearly 
independent and hence a basis of $B/I$. Thus $f$ maps a basis onto a basis, so it is 
an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\section{Quantum affine toric degeneration of quantum Schubert varieties}
\label{q-flag-schubert}
In this section we apply the results in the previous section to study Schubert varieties 
of quantum flag varieties. We recall the definitions of quantum flag and Schubert 
varieties found with some detail in order to establish notation, and following 
Littelmann we associate to each a an affine semigroup $S$. We then use an argument due to
P. Caldero to show that each quantum Schubert variety has an $(S, <)$-basis in the sense of 
\ref{lex-degeneration}, and hence has a quantum toric degeneration with associated 
semigroup $S$. The main ingredient for the construction of this basis is the canonical
or global basis of $U_q^-(\g)$, discovered independently by Lusztig and Kashiwara, so we
recall its main properties.

\subsection*{Quantum flag and Schubert varieties}

\paragraph
\label{lie-algebra-notation}
Let $\g$ be a complex semisimple Lie algebra and let $G$ be the corresponding simply 
connected Lie group. We denote by $\Phi = \{\alpha_1, \ldots,\alpha_n\}$ the set simple 
roots of $\g$; by $\ZZ\Phi$ be the root lattice; by $\{\varpi_1, \ldots, \varpi_n\}$ be 
the set of fundamental weights; and by $\Lambda$ the weight lattice of $\g$. Set
$\Lambda^+ = \sum_i \NN \varpi_i$ be the set of dominant weights. 

Let $W$ be the Weyl group of $\g$, and $s_i \in W$ the reflection corresponding to the 
$i$-th simple root. Given an element $w \in W$ we denote its length by $\ell(w)$, and set 
$N$ to be the length of the longest word of $W$. A \emph{decomposition} of $w \in W$ is a 
word on the generators $s_i$ that equals $w$ in $W$. A decomposition of the longest word of 
$W$ is said to be \emph{adapted} to $w$ if it is of the form $s_{i_1} \ldots s_{i_N}$ with 
$s_{i_1} \ldots s_{i_{\ell(w)}} = w$. For every element $w \in W$ there exists a 
decomposition of the longest word of $W$ adapted to $w$. In other words the longest word of 
$W$ is the maximum for the weak right Bruhat order on $W$, see 
\cite{BB}*{Proposition 3.1.2}.

\paragraph
\label{quantized-enveloping-algebra}
Fix $q \in \k^\times$ not a root of unity. Let $U_q(\g)$ be the quantum enveloping 
algebra of adjoint type of $\g$ as defined in \cite{Jan}*{Definition 4.3 and paragraph 
4.5}. Let $U_q^+(\g), U_q^-(\g)$ be the positive and negative parts of $U_q(\g)$ as defined 
in \cite{Jan}*{4.4}. Recall that for each $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$ there is an irreducible 
highest-weight representation of $U_q(\g)$ of type $\mathbf{1}$, which we denote by 
$V_q(\lambda)$. Each $V_q(\lambda)$ decomposes as the direct sum of weight spaces 
$\bigoplus_{\mu \in L(\lambda)} V_q(\lambda)_\mu$, where $L(\lambda)$ is a finite subset of 
$\Lambda$; the dimensions of the weight spaces are the same as in the classical case, so 
the Weyl character formulas holds for these representations, see 
\cite{Jan}*{subsection 5.15}.

\paragraph
Since $U_q(\g)$ is a Hopf algebra, its Hopf dual $U_q(\g)^{\circ}$ is an algebra with 
convolution product induced by the coproduct of $U_q(\g)$. There is a map 
$V_q(\lambda)^* \ot V_q(\lambda) \to U_q(\g)^\circ$ defined by
sending $\phi \ot v \in V_q(\lambda)^* \ot V_q(\lambda)$ to the linear functional
$c^\lambda_{\phi, v}$, which assigns to each $u \in U_q(\g)$ the scalar $c^\lambda_{\phi,
v}(u) = \phi(uv)$. Functionals of type $c^\lambda_{\phi, v}$ are called \emph{matrix
coefficients}. The $\k$-linear span of the matrix coefficients is a subalgebra of 
$U_q(\g)^\circ$ denoted by $\O_q[G]$, called the quantized algebra of coordinate functions 
over the group $G$. 

\paragraph
\label{q-full-flag-varieties}
Quantum flag varieties were introduced by Soibelman in \cite{S} and by Lakshmibai and 
Reshetikhin in \cite{qLR}; we review their definition. 
Fix a maximal Borel subgroup $B$ of $G$. The \emph{full flag variety} associated to $G$ 
is $G/B$. Let $C^+_q(\lambda)$ be the vector space of matrix coefficients of the form
$c^\lambda_{\phi,v_{\lambda}}$ in $U_q(\g)^*$, where $v_\lambda$ is a highest weight
vector in $V_q(\lambda)$, and set 
\[ 
  \O_q[G/B] = \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \Lambda^+} C^+_q(\lambda) \subset \O_q[G] 
    \subset U_q(\g)^*.  
\] 
This is called the \emph{quantum full flag variety} of $G$. By definition the product of 
two matrix coefficients in $\O_q[G/B]$ is again in $\O_q[G/B]$, and its decomposition 
as a direct sum gives $\O_q[G/B]$ the structure of a $\Lambda^+$-graded 
algebra. 

\paragraph
Let $I$ be a subset of the set of fundamental weights and set $\mathcal J(I) = 
\sum_{\varpi_i \notin I} \NN \varpi_i$. Denote by $W_I \subset W$ the subgroup 
generated by the reflections $s_i$ with $\varpi_i \in I$, and for each class in 
$W/W_I$ pick a representative of minimal length. We denote by $W^I$ the set of these 
representatives. Since the Demazure character formula holds, for each $w \in W^I$ and 
each $\lambda \in \mathcal J(I)$ the vector space $V_q(\lambda)_{w\lambda}$ has 
dimension $1$. The \emph{Demazure module} $V_q(\lambda)_{w}$ is the 
$U_q^+(\g)$-submodule of $V_q(\lambda)$ generated by a vector of weight $w\lambda$
in $V_q(\lambda)$.

The set $I$ determines a Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak p \subset \g$, and a parabolic 
subgroup $P_I \subset G$. The variety $G/P_I$ is the corresponding generalized flag 
variety. To this datum we associate the $\Lambda^+$-graded subalgebra of $\O_q[G/B]$ 
\[ 
  \O_q[G/P_I]:= \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \mathcal J(I)} C_q^+(\lambda) 
\] 
called the \emph{quantum partial flag variety associated to $I$}. The case 
$I = \emptyset$ corresponds to the full flag variety.

\paragraph
\label{q-Schubert-varieties}
Given vector spaces $V_2 \subset V_1$, we denote by $V_2^\perp$ the set of linear
functionals over $V_1$ which are zero on $V_2$. For every $w \in W^I$, the vector space 
\[
  J_w^I = \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \mathcal J(I)} \vspan{c_{\phi,v_\lambda}^\lambda
  \in C_q^+(\lambda) \mid \phi  \in V_q(\lambda)_w^\perp } \subset \O_q[G/P_I] 
\] 
is an ideal of $\O_q[G/P_I]$ called the \emph{Schubert ideal} associated to $w$. The
quotient algebra $\O_q[G/P_I]_w = \O_q[G/P_I]/J^I_w$ is called the \emph{quantum Schubert
variety} associated to $w$.

\subsection*{Degeneration of quantum Schubert varieties}
%\label{qtad-flag}
In this subsection we assume that $\k$ is of characteristic zero and that $q \in 
\k^\times$ is trascendental over $\QQ$. Our aim is to show that under these conditions 
quantum Schubert varieties have quantum affine toric degenerations. In order to do so we 
work for a moment over the field $\QQ(v)$, where $v$ is an indeterminate over $\QQ$, and 
consider the $\QQ(v)$-algebra $U = U_v(\g)$. The general case will follow by extension 
of scalars. 

We now review Caldero's argument on the existence of an $(S,<)$-basis of $\O_q[G/B]$,
and its natural extension to arbitrary partial flag and Schubert varieties. Since he
was interested in classical flag varieties, Caldero works with a large base field 
$\CC(q)$ that allows him to specialize at $q=1$ and still get algebraic varieties over
the complex numbers. His arguments go through almost word by word in our context, but we 
believe it is worthwhile to retrace it in some detail.

\paragraph
We denote by $U^+$ and $U^-$ the algebras $U^+_v(\g)$ and $U^-_v(\g)$, respectively. Let 
$\A = \ZZ[v, v^{-1}] \subset \QQ(v)$. The algebra $U$ has an $\A$-form, defined 
equivalently in \cite{Jan}*{section 11.1}, which we denote by $U_\A$. This is a 
subring of $U$, and the algebras $U^+$ and $U^-$ also have $\A$-forms which we denote by 
$U_\A^+$ and $U_\A^-$, respectively, and all these $\A$-forms are compatible with the
weight decomposition of $U$. By construction $U \cong \QQ(v) \ot_\A U_\A$, and 
analogous results hold for $U_\A^+$ and $U_\A^-$. Furthermore the highest weight modules 
$V_v(\lambda)$ have corresponding $\A$-forms which we denote by $V_\A(\lambda)$. All these 
$\A$-forms are compatible with the weight decompositions of the original objects, see 
\cite{Jan}*{chapters 9,10}. 
Now let $\lambda$ be a dominant weight and fix $w \in W$. The $\A$-form of the Demazure 
module $V_q(\lambda)_{w}$ is defined as $V_\A(\lambda)_{w} = U^+ V_\A(\lambda)_{w\lambda}$.

\paragraph
\label{T:A-crystal-basis} 
The algebra $U_\A^-$ has a homogeneous $\A$-basis, called the \emph{canonical 
basis} of $U^-$, discovered independently by Lusztig and Kashiwara. Its contruction
is the subject of \cite{Jan}*{chapters 9 - 11}, and we will use the notation from this
source to recapitulate some relevant facts. 

Set $A_0 \subset \QQ(v)$ to be the ring of rational functions without a pole at $0$, define 
the operators $\tilde F_\alpha: U_\A^- \to U_\A^-$ as in \cite{Jan}*{10.2}, and 
let $\L(\infty)$ be the $A_0$-lattice generated by all elements of the form
$\tilde F_{i_1} \tilde F_{i_2} \cdots \tilde F_{i_r}(1)$; by definition
these are weight elements, so setting $\L(\infty)_{-\nu} = \L(\infty) \cap U^-_{-\nu}$, we
get $\L(\infty) = \bigoplus_{\nu \geq 0} \L(\infty)_{-\nu}$, and furthermore each
$\L(\infty)_{-\nu}$ is a finitely generated $A_0$-module that generates $U^-_\nu$ over 
$\QQ(q)$. By definition, $\B(\infty)_{-\nu} \subset \L(\infty)_{-\nu} / q 
\L(\infty)_{-\nu}$ is the set of all $\tilde F_{i_1} \tilde F_{i_2} \cdots 
\tilde F_{i_r}(1) + q\L(\infty)$ such that $\sum_i \alpha_i = \nu$, and 
$\B(\infty) = \bigsqcup_{\nu \geq 0} \B_{-\nu}$ \cite{Jan}*{10.3}. Although it is not 
obvious, $\B(\infty)_{-\nu}$ is a basis of $\L(\infty)_{-\nu} / q \L(\infty)_{-\nu}$ 
\cite{Jan}*{Proposition 10.11}. It turns out that each $b \in \B(\infty)_{-\nu}$ has a 
unique lift $G(b) \in \L(\infty)_{-\nu} \cap (U_\A^-)_{-\nu}$, which is invariant under the 
action of certain automorphisms of $U$. \cite{Jan}*{Theorem 11.10 a)}. The set of all 
$G(b)$ with $b \in \B(\infty)$ is called the global basis of $U_\A^-$.

Let $w \in W$, and let $w = s_{i_1}\cdots s_{i_r}$ be a reduced decomposition of $w$. 
Set $\B_w(\infty)$ as the set of elements in $B(\infty)$ of the form $\tilde 
F_{\alpha_{i_1}}^{k_1} \tilde F_{\alpha_{i_2}}^{k_2} \cdots \tilde 
F_{\alpha_{i_r}}^{k_r}(1) + q\L(\infty)$. This set does not depend on the decomposition 
\cite{K1}*{Proposition 3.2.5}.

\begin{Theorem*}
Let $\nu \in \ZZ \Phi$ with $\nu \geq 0$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item The set $\{G(b) \mid b \in \B_{-\nu}\}$ is an $\A$ basis of $(U_\A^-)_{- \nu}$.

\item Let $\lambda$ be a dominant weight and let $v_\lambda$ be a highest weight vector of 
$V_\A(\lambda)$. The set $\{G(b)v_\lambda \mid b \in \B(\infty)_{-\nu}\} \setminus \{0\}$
is an $\A$-basis of $V_\A(\lambda)_{\lambda - \nu}$. Furthermore, if $G(b)v_\lambda = 
G(b')v_\lambda \neq 0$ then $b = b'$.

\item Let $w \in W$. The set $\{G(b)v_\lambda \mid b \in \B_w(\infty)\} \setminus \{0\}$
is an $\A$-basis of $V_\A(\lambda)_{w}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem*}
\begin{proof}
The first two items are part of \cite{Jan}*{Theorem 11.10}. The third is 
\cite{K1}*{Proposition 3.2.5 (vi)}.
\end{proof}


Since $\B$ consists of weight elements, setting $\B_\nu = 
\B \cap (U_\A^-)_{-\nu}$ for each $\nu \in \ZZ \Phi$, $\nu \geq 0$, we get $\B = 
\bigsqcup_\nu \B_\nu$.
\begin{Theorem*} 
Let $\nu \in \ZZ\Phi$ with $\nu \geq 0$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\lambda \in \Lambda^+$, let $v_\lambda \in V_\A(\lambda)$ be a highest 
weight vector, and let $\B_\nu(\lambda) = \{b \in \B_\nu \mid b v_\lambda \neq 0\}$. Then 
$B_\nu(\lambda) v_\lambda = \{b v_\lambda \mid b \in \B_\nu(\lambda)\}$ is an $\A$-basis
of the weight component $V_\A(\lambda)_{\lambda - \nu}$.

\item Let $w \in W$. There exists $\B_{w} \subset \B$, independent of $\lambda$,
such that $\B_{w} \cap \B_\nu(\lambda)v_\lambda$ is an $\A$-basis of the weight component 
$(V_\A(\lambda)_w)_{\lambda - \nu}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem*} 
\begin{proof} 
The first item is part of \cite{Jan}*{Theorem 11.10}. The second one is essentially 
\cite{K1}*{Remark 3.2.6}; notice that there is a typo in this remark: where Kashiwara 
writes $U_q^\ZZ(\g)$ he should write $U_q^+(\g)_\ZZ$, or in our case $U_\A^+$. It also 
follows from \cite{Lit}*{Theorem 10.2 and Proposition 10.3}.
\end{proof}
The set $\B_w$ can be described explicitly, or at least as explicitly as the set $\B$.
The basis $\B_\nu$ consists of elements of $U_\A^- \subset U^-$.

\paragraph
\label{L:are-semigroups}
Littelman proved in \cite{Lit}*{Proposition 1.5, a)} that for every decomposition $w_0$ 
of the longest word of $W$ there is a parametrization of the canonical basis $\B$ by a 
set $\S_{w_0} \subset \NN^N$, where $N$ is the length of the longest word of $W$.  For 
each $s \in \S_{w_0}$ let $b_{s}$ denote the corresponding element in the canonical 
basis. Thus if $\lambda$ is a dominant weight then there exists a finite set 
$S_{\lambda, w_0} \subset S_{w_0}$ such that $\B_\lambda = \{b_s \mid s \in 
S_{\lambda, w_0} \}$.

Let $I$ be a subset of the fundamental weights, let $w \in W^I$, and let $w_0$ be a 
decomposition of the longest word of $W$ adapted to $w$. Following \cite{C} we set 
\begin{align*} 
  \tilde \S_{w_0} 
    &= \{(s,\lambda) \mid s \in S_{\lambda,w_0}\} 
    \subset \NN^N \times \Lambda^+ \cong \NN^{N+n},\\ 
  \tilde \S_{w_0}^w 
    &= \{(s,\lambda) \in \tilde \S_{w_0} \mid b_s \in \B_\lambda \cap \B_w\},  \\ 
  \tilde \S_{w_0,I}^w 
    &= \{(s,\lambda) \in \tilde S_{w_0}^w \mid \lambda \in \mathcal J(I)\} 
    = \tilde S_{w_0}^w \cap (\NN^N \times \mathcal J(I)).  
\end{align*} 
These are semigroups with a total order given by the restriction of the lexicographic 
order of $\NN^{N + n}$. By abuse of notation, we denote this order by $\leq_{\lex}$.  

\begin{Lemma*} 
The sets $\tilde \S_{w_0}, \tilde \S_{w_0}^w$ and $\tilde \S_{w_0, I}^w$ are normal 
affine semigroups.  
\end{Lemma*} 
\begin{proof} 
For $\tilde \S_{w_0}$ and $\tilde \S_{w_0}^w$ see \cite{C}*{Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.4}
respectively. By definition $\tilde \S_{w_0,I}^w = \tilde S_{w_0}^w \cap (\NN^N \times
\mathcal J(I))$, and Gordan's Lemma \cite{BH}*{Proposition 6.1.2} implies that the 
intersection of normal semigroups is normal. 
%Let $D = \RR_+ \tilde S_{w_0}^w$ and let $G$ be the group of fractions of 
%$\NN^n \times \mathcal J(I)$. Since $\tilde S_{w_0}^w$ is normal, Gordan's Lemma 
%\cite{BH}*{Proposition 6.1.2} implies it is equal to $D \cap (\ZZ^n \times P)$. Now 
%every point of $G \cap D$ lies in $\tilde S_{w_0}^w$, and hence in $\NN^n \times P^+$. 
%Thus 
%\[ 
  %\tilde S^w_{w_0,I} 
    %= \tilde S_{w_0}^w \cap (\NN^n \times \mathcal J(I)) 
    %= D \cap (\NN^n \times \mathcal J(I)) 
    %= D \cap G, 
%\]
%and Gordan's Lemma implies that $D \cap G$ is a normal semigroup.  
\end{proof}

\paragraph
Let $\lambda$ be a dominant integral weight. By Theorem \ref{T:A-crystal-basis}, the set
$\B_\lambda v_\lambda$ is a basis of $V_v(\lambda)$, and hence it has a dual basis
$\B_\lambda^*$. For every $s \in S_\lambda$ there is an element $b_{s,\lambda}^* \in
\B_\lambda^*$ defined as the only functional that sends $b v_\lambda$ to $\delta_{b,b_s}$
for all $b \in \B$. Each linear functional $b^*_{s, \lambda}$ induces a matrix 
coefficient which by abuse of notation we will also denote by $b^*_{s, \lambda}$. We 
denote by $C^+_\A$ the sub $\A$-module of $C^+_v(\lambda)$ generated by these matrix 
coefficients, and set 
\[ 
  \O_\A[G/B] = \bigoplus_{\lambda \in \Lambda^+} C^+_\A(\lambda).  
\] 
Clearly $\O_\A[G/B] \subset \O_v[G/B] \subset U_v(\g)^*$. The product of $\O_v[G/B]$ is 
induced by the product of this last algebra, which in turn is induced by the coproduct 
of $U_v(\g)$. Since $U_\A$ is stable by the coproduct, $\O_\A[G/B]$ is a sub 
$\A$-algebra of $\O_q[G/B]$.

Setting 
\begin{align*} 
\B_{\lambda, w}^* 
  &= \{b_{s, \lambda}^* \mid (s, \lambda) \in \tilde S_{w_0, I}^w \}, \\ 
\B_{\lambda, w}^\perp 
  &= \{b_{s, \lambda} \in B_\lambda^* \cap V_v(\lambda)_w^\perp\} 
\end{align*} 
we see that $\B_\lambda = \B_{\lambda, w}^* \sqcup \B_{\lambda, w}^\perp$, and 
$\B_{\lambda, w}^\perp$ is a basis of $V_v(\lambda)_w^\perp$, while the restrictions of 
the functionals of $\B_{\lambda, w}^*$ to $V_v(\lambda)_w$ form a basis of 
$V_v(\lambda)_w^*$.  Hence it is possible to define $\A$-forms of arbitrary quantum 
Schubert varieties, and by definition the image of matrix coefficients $b_{s, \lambda}^*$
with $(s, \lambda) \in \tilde S_{w_0, I}^w$ form an $\A$-basis of the $\A$-algebra 
$\O_\A[G/P_I]_w$. We keep abusing notation and denote the image of $b_{s, \lambda}^*$ in 
this quotient by the same symbol.

\begin{Proposition} 
\label{P:basis-product} 
Let $I$ be a finite set of fundamental weights, let $w \in W^I$, and let $w_0$ be a 
decomposition of the longest word of $W$ adapted to $w$. Then for every $(s,
\lambda), (s', \lambda'), (s'', \lambda'') \in \tilde S_{w_0, I}^w$ such that $(s'',
\lambda'') <_{\lex} (s + s', \lambda + \lambda')$ there exist $c_{s, s'}^{s''} \in \A$ 
and $c = c((s,\lambda),(s',\lambda')) \in \ZZ$ such that 
\begin{align}
\label{product-formula} 
b_{(s, \lambda)}^* b_{(s', \lambda')}^* 
  = v^c b_{(s+s', \lambda + \lambda')}^* 
    + \sum_{s'' <_{\lex} s+s'} c_{s,s'}^{s''} b_{(s'', \lambda + \lambda')}^*.  
\end{align} 
\end{Proposition} 
\begin{proof} 
Let $\k = \CC(t^{1/d})$, where $d$ is the length of the longest root of $\g$. Then there
is an obvious map $\QQ(v) \to \k$ sending $v$ to $t$. This induces a morphism of
Hopf algebras $U_v(\g) \hookrightarrow U_t(\g)$. The canonical basis $\B$ of $U_v(\g)$
maps to a basis of $U_t(\g)$, and since Demazure modules are preserved by extension of
scalars, \ref{T:A-crystal-basis} still holds over $U_t(\g)$ (see the reference given
there). Thus there is an obvious injective $\A$-linear morphism from $C_\A^+(\lambda)$ to
$C_t^+(\lambda)$, and hence an injective $\A$-linear morphism $\O_\A[G/B] \to \O_t[G/B]$;
this morphism is multiplicative since the extensions $U_\A \hookrightarrow U_v(\g)
\hookrightarrow U_t(\g)$ are morphisms of coalgebras. Thus it is enough to establish that
the formula holds in $\O_t[G/B]$, which is done in \cite{C}*{Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 
2.3}.
\end{proof} 

\begin{Theorem}
\label{Schubert-deg}
The quantum Schubert variety $\O_q[G/P_I]_w$ degenerates to a quantum affine toric 
variety with associated semigroup $\tilde S^w_{w_0, I}$. In particular any quantum 
Schubert variety has property $\chi$, finite local dimension, the AS-Cohen-Macaulay 
property, and is a maximal order in its skew-field of fractions.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Proposition \ref{P:basis-product} $\O_q[G/P_I]_w$ has an ordered $\tilde 
S^w_{w_0,I}$-basis with respect to $\leq_{\lex}$,so the first part of the statement
follows from Proposition \ref{lex-degeneration}.

Since $\tilde S^w_{w_0, I}$ is a normal semigroup, we know by Proposition 
\ref{properties-of-qatv} that the associated graded ring of the quantum Schubert variety
has property $\chi$, finite local dimension and the AS-Cohen-Macaulay property, which 
$\O_q[G/P_I]_w$ inherits by Theorem \ref{transfer}. Also by Proposition 
\ref{properties-of-qatv}, the quantum affine toric variety is a maximal order in its 
ring of fractions, and it follows from \cite{Mau}*{Chapitre IV, Proposition 2.1 and 
Chapitre V, Corollaire 2.6} that $\O_q[G/P_I]_w$ is also a maximal order. 
\end{proof}

\section{Quantum affine toric degeneration of an algebras with a straightening law over 
a distributive lattice}
\label{richardson}

We finish this article by relating our previous work \cite{RZ} with the material found 
here. In that article we proved that Richardson varieties in the quantum grassmanian as 
defined in \cite{RZ}*{Definition 5.2.1} are symmetric quantum graded algebras with a 
straightening law over a poset \cite{RZ}*{Definition 3.1}, and that they satisfy a 
technical ``Condition (C)'' \cite{RZ}*{Definition 4.1}. In \cite{RZ}*{Theorem 4.9} we 
proved that, in the language of the present article, all symmetric quantum graded ASL's 
satisfying condition (C) have quantum toric degenerations. We now prove a similar result
under conditions milder than (C). In order to do this, we place 
ourselves in the context of \cite{RZ2}*{section 3}, the reader is referred to it for 
definitions and unexplained notation.

\paragraph
For the rest of this subsection $\L$ denotes a finite distributive lattice. Given $x,y 
\in \L$ we denote their meet by $x \meet y$ and their join by $x \join y$, as usual. 
Recall that the rank of $\L$ is defined as the length of any maximal chain in $\L$, which
we denote by $r$. We also denote by $J(\L)$ the set of join irreducible elements of 
$\L$, so $r = |J(\L)|$. We see $J(\L)$ as a poset with the order induced by $\L$, and
extend this to a total order, so $J(\L) = \{p_1, \ldots, p_n\}$ and $p_i < p_j$ implies 
$i < j$. Birkhoff's representation theorem states that $\L$ is isomorphic to the lattice
of poset ideals of $J(\L)$, through the assignation $l \in \L \mapsto \{p \in J(I) \mid 
p \leq l\}$.

\paragraph 
As shown in \cite{RZ2}*{section 3.3}, associated to $\L$ there is a semigroup $S(\L)$, 
defined as follows: $S(\L)$ is the abelian semigroup generated by $\L$ modulo the 
relations $\{x + y \equiv (x \meet y) + (x \join y) \mid x,y \in \L\}$.
The map $\iota: \L \to \NN^{r}$ defined as
\[
  \iota(l) = \sum_{\{i : p_i \leq l\}} e_i,
\]
for each $l \in L$ is injective and a lattice morphism. 
By \cite{RZ2}*{Proposition 3.3.3}, $\iota$ induces an injective semigroup morphism 
$\iota: S(\L) \to \NN^{r}$ whose image is a full normal subsemigroup, so $S(\L)$ is a
normal affine semigroup. 

Set $n = |\L|$; write $\L = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$, and set $s_i = \iota(x_i)$ for each 
$1 \leq i \leq n$. Let $\pi: \NN^n \to S(\L)$ be the semigroup morphism induced 
by the assignation $e_i \mapsto s_i$ for all $i$. It follows from 
\cite{RZ2}*{Lemma 3.3.2} that every element of $S(\L)$ can be 
written in a unique way as $s = \sum_{i=1}^n m_i s_i$ with the condition that the set 
$\{x_i \mid m_i \neq 0\}$ is a chain of $\L$. Setting $t(s) = (m_1, \ldots, m_n)$ we 
obtain a section $t: S(\L) \to \NN^n$ of $\pi$. We refer to $t$ as the \emph{standard 
section} of $\pi$. 

\paragraph
For every pair of elements $x,y \in \L$ we define
\begin{align*} 
  R(x,y) &= \{(z,z') \in \L \times \L \mid z < x, y  <z'\}.  
\end{align*} 
We write $R(x,y)^*$ for $R(x,y) \setminus (x \meet y, x \join y)$.

\paragraph
We continue to denote by $A$ an $\NN^r$-graded noetherian algebra.
Suppose that there is an injective function $[-]: \L \to A$. A \emph{standard monomial} 
in $A$ is a product of the form $[x_0] [x_1] \ldots [x_n]$ with $x_{i} \leq x_{i+1}$ for 
all $1 \leq i < n$. 
\begin{Definition*}
\label{D:symm-q-gr-asl} 
Let $\L$ be a finite distributive lattice, and let $[-]: \L \to A$ be an injective 
function. We say that $A$ is a 
\emph{symmetric quantum graded algebra with a straightening law over $\L$}, or symmetric 
quantum ASL for short, if the following hold.

\begin{enumerate} 
  \item The set $\{[x] \mid x \in \L\}$ consists of homogeneous elements of nonzero
    degree that generate $A$ as an algebra.

  \item The set of standard monomials is linearly independent.

  \item For every $x,y \in \L$ there exist $\{c^{z,z'}_{x,y}\}_{(z,z') \in R(x,y)^*}
  \subset \k$ and $c_{x,y} \in \k^\times$, such that 
  \begin{align*} 
    [y][x] = c_{x,y} [x][y] + \sum_{(z,z') \in R(x,y)^*} c^{z,z'}_{x,y} [z][z'].  
  \end{align*}

  \item For every pair of incomparable elements $x,y \in \L$ there exist
  $\{d^{z,z'}_{x,y}\}_{(z,z') \in R(x,y)^*} \subset \k$ and $d_{x,y} \in \k^\times$, such
  that
  \begin{align*} 
    [x][y] = d_{x,y} [x \meet y][x \join y] +
    \sum_{(z,z') \in R(x,y)^*} d^{z,z'}_{x,y} [z][z'].  \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate} 
\end{Definition*}
\begin{Remark*}
The word \emph{symmetric} is there to distinguish this class from the more general class
of quantum graded ASL's over a poset, defined in \cite{LR1}*{Definition 1.1.1}. Also
notice that the definition of a symmetric quantum ASL over a general poset $P$ given in
\cite{RZ}*{Definition 3.1} is slightly more general, as it does not require that 
$d_{x,y} \neq 0$. This simple requirement is what takes the place of the much more 
technical condition $(C)$.
\end{Remark*}

\begin{Theorem} 
\label{T:ASL-are-dominated} 
If $A$ is a symmetric quantum graded ASL over $\L$ then it has a quantum affine toric 
degeneration with associated semigroup $S(\L)$.
\end{Theorem} 
\begin{proof} 
Let $C = \{\iota(x) + \iota(y) \mid x,y \in \L\}$. This is a finite set, and so by 
reasoning as in the proof of Proposition \ref{lex-degeneration} there is a morphism 
$\phi: \NN^{\rk \L} \to \NN$ such that $\xi <_{\lex} \nu$ implies $\phi(\xi) < 
\phi(\nu)$ for all $\xi, \nu \in C$. 

Let $x,y \in \L$ and let $(z,z') \in R(x,y)^*$. Using Birkhoff's representation theorem, 
it follows from the defintion of $\iota$ that $\iota(z') - \iota(y) <_{\lex} \iota(x) - 
\iota(z)$, or equivalently $\iota(z) + \iota(z') <_{\lex} \iota(x) + \iota(y)$. Thus by 
definition $A$ is of $(S,\phi)$-type with generators $b_i = [x_i]$. Also, by 
\cite{LR1}*{Proposition 1.14}, standard monomials form a basis of $A$. The set of 
standard monomials is the generating set associated to the standard section $t$ as 
defined in \ref{P:equivalent-qatd}, so the proposition in that paragraph implies that
$A$ has a quantum toric degeneration with associated semigroup $S(\L)$.
\end{proof}

Our objective in the present article is to adapt to the quantum setting a technique that 
has been a staple of algebraic geometry during the last thirty years, namely that of 
toric degenerations, and apply this technique to the study of quantum analogues of 
Schubert varieties in arbitrary flag varieties. This statement is made in the spirit of 
noncommutative algebraic geometry, in the sense that we see quantum varieties as defined 
implicitly by a noncommutative deformation of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a 
classical variety.

By degeneration we refer to the process of deforming an algebraic variety $V$ over a 
field $\k$ into a new variety $T$. In the simpler examples, this is done by finding a 
flat regular map $p: W \to \AA^1(\k)$ such that a generic fiber is 
isomorphic to $V$ but a special fiber, usually $p^{-1}(0)$, is isomorphic to $T$. If we 
have such a flat deformation of $V$ into $T$, then we can show that $V$ has some nice 
property by showing first that $T$ has the desired property, and then using flatness to 
show that this proprety extends to all fibers. A \emph{toric} degeneration is one in
which the target $T$ of the degeneration is a toric variety. The underlying combinatorial
structure of toric varieties is well documented, see for example \cite{MS}*{section II}, 
and has been aplied to study many of their homological and geometrical properties with 
great success, which makes them an ideal target for a degeneration.

The degeneration process can be carried out by purely algebraic means. In this case, the 
transfer of properties from $T$ to $V$ can be understood in algebraic terms as the 
classic idea of studying a ring $A$ by filtering it and passing to an associated graded 
ring. Of course this idea is not new in noncommutative algebra. Our contribution is to 
show that degeneration techniques are well suited to study the regularity properties of
homological nature and geometrical flavor usually found in noncommutative algebraic 
geometry, such as being AS-Cohen-Macaulay, having finite local dimension, etc. Once
we have proved this, we introduce the notion of an algebra with a \emph{quantum affine 
toric degeneration}, i.e. a graded algebra with a filtration by graded subspaces whose
associated graded algebra is a quantum affine toric variety. These quantum varieties 
were studied in our previous article \cite{RZ2}, where we showed that they share most 
of the combinatorial and homological properties of their classical counterparts, and 
hence are well-suited to be the target of a noncommutative degeneration. As an example, 
we show that Schubert subvarieties of quantum flag varieties have quantum affine toric 
degenerations and thus establish that they are AS-Cohen-Macaulay and maximal orders
in their skew-fields of fractions.

Since we were interested in applying these techniques to quantum flag and Schubert 
varieties, the works of Gonciulea and Lakshmibai \cite{GL} and Caldero \cite{C} served 
as guiding examples. In particular the last article uses techniques from quantum groups 
to prove that Schubert subvarieties of flag varieties have toric degenerations, and 
was the main inspiration to the present article.
